_ _ roosevelt countered that it was best for the filipinos to have stability and the americans to have a proud place in the world _ _

_ _ roosevelt worked closely with interior secretary james rudolph garfield and chief of the united states forest service gifford pinchot to enact a series of conservation programs that often met with resistance from western members of congress such as charles william fulton _ _
_ _ nonetheless roosevelt established the united states forest service signed into law the creation of five national parks and signed the 1906 antiquities act under which he proclaimed 18 new us national monuments _ _

_ _ roosevelt was unapologetic about his extensive use of executive orders to protect the environment despite the perception in congress that he was encroaching on too many lands _ _
_ _ eventually senator charles fulton ror attached an amendment to an agricultural appropriations bill that effectively prevented the president from reserving any further land _ _
_ _ before signing that bill into law roosevelt used executive orders to establish an additional 21 forest reserves waiting until the last minute to sign the bill into law _ _

_ _ wall streets stock market entered a slump in early 1907 and many investors blamed roosevelts regulatory policies for the decline in stock prices _ _
_ _ roosevelt helped calm the crisis by meeting on november 4 1907 with the leaders of us steel and approving their plan to purchase a tennessee steel company near bankruptcy—its failure would ruin a major new york bank _ _
_ _ he thus approved the growth of one of the largest and most hated trusts while the public announcement calmed the markets _ _
_ _ roosevelt exploded in anger at the superrich for the economic malfeasance calling them malefactors of great wealth _ _
_ _ in a major speech in august entitled the puritan spirit and the regulation of corporations _ _
_ _ trying to restore confidence he blamed the crisis primarily on europe but then after saluting the unbending rectitude of the puritans he went on _ _
_ _ it may well be that the determination of the governmentto punish certain malefactors of great wealth has been responsible for something of the trouble at least to the extent of having caused these men to combine to bring about as much financial stress as possible in order to discredit the policy of the government and thereby secure a reversal of that policy so that they may enjoy unmolested the fruits of their own evildoing _ _
_ _ regarding the very wealthy roosevelt privately scorned _ _
_ _ their entire unfitness to govern the country and  the lasting damage they do by much of what they think are the legitimate big business operations of the day _ _
_ _ the american annexation of hawaii in 1898 was stimulated in part by fear that otherwise japan would dominate or seize the hawaiian republic _ _
_ _ similarly germany was the alternative to american takeover of the philippines in 1900 and tokyo strongly preferred the us to take over _ _
_ _ as the us became a naval world power it needed to find a way to avoid a military confrontation in the pacific with japan _ _
_ _ in the 1890s roosevelt had been an ardent imperialist and vigorously defended the permanent acquisition of the philippines in the 1900 campaign _ _
_ _ after the local insurrection ended in 1902 roosevelt wished to have a strong us presence in the region as a symbol of democratic values but he did not envision any new acquisitions _ _
_ _ one of roosevelts priorities during his presidency and afterwards was the maintenance of friendly relations with japan _ _

_ _ it ended explicit discrimination against the japanese and japan agreed not to allow unskilled immigrants into the united states _ _
_ _ the great white fleet of american battleships visited japan in 1908 during its roundtheworld tour _ _
_ _ roosevelt intended to emphasize the superiority of the american fleet over the smaller japanese navy but instead of resentment the visitors arrived to a joyous welcome by japanese elite as well as the general public _ _
_ _ this goodwill facilitated the root–takahira agreement of november 1908 which reaffirmed the status quo of japanese control of korea and american control of the philippines _ _
_ _  _ _
_ _ success in the war against spain and the new empire plus having the largest economy in the world meant that the united states had emerged as a world power _ _
_ _ roosevelt searched for ways to win recognition for the position abroad _ _
_ _ roosevelt also played a major role in mediating the first moroccan crisis by calling the algeciras conference which averted war between france and germany _ _
_ _ roosevelts presidency saw the strengthening of ties with great britain _ _
_ _ the great rapprochement had begun with british support of the united states during the spanish–american war and it continued as britain withdrew its fleet from the caribbean in favor of focusing on the rising german naval threat _ _
_ _ in 1901 britain and the united states signed the hay–pauncefote treaty abrogating the clayton–bulwer treaty which had prevented the united states from constructing a canal connecting the pacific and the atlantic ocean _ _
_ _ the longstanding alaska boundary dispute was settled on terms favorable to the united states as great britain was unwilling to alienate the united states over what it considered to be a secondary issue _ _
_ _ as roosevelt later put it the resolution of the alaskan boundary dispute settled the last serious trouble between the british empire and ourselves _ _
_ _ as president he primarily focused the nations overseas ambitions on the caribbean especially locations that had a bearing on the defense of his pet project the panama canal _ _
_ _ roosevelt also increased the size of the navy and by the end of his second term the united states had more battleships than any other country besides britain _ _
_ _ the panama canal when it opened in 1914 allowed the us navy to rapidly move back and forth from the pacific to the caribbean to european waters _ _
_ _ in december 1902 the germans british and italians blockaded the ports of venezuela in order to force the repayment of delinquent loans _ _
_ _ roosevelt was particularly concerned with the motives of german emperor wilhelm ii _ _
_ _ he succeeded in getting the three nations to agree to arbitration by tribunal at the hague and successfully defused the crisis _ _
_ _ the latitude granted to the europeans by the arbiters was in part responsible for the roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine which the president issued in 1904 chronic wrongdoing or an impotence which results in a general loosening of the ties of civilized society may in america as elsewhere ultimately require intervention by some civilized nation and in the western hemisphere the adherence of the united states to the monroe doctrine may force the united states however reluctantly in flagrant cases of such wrongdoing or impotence to the exercise of an international police power _ _
_ _ the pursuit of an isthmus canal in central america during this period focused on two possible routes—nicaragua and panama which was then a rebellious district within colombia _ _
_ _ roosevelt convinced congress to approve the panamanian alternative and a treaty was approved only to be rejected by the colombian government _ _
_ _ when the panamanians learned of this a rebellion followed was supported by roosevelt and succeeded _ _
_ _ a treaty with the new panama government for construction of the canal was then reached in 1903 _ _
_ _ roosevelt received criticism for paying the bankrupt panama canal company and the new panama canal company 40000000 equivalent to 1206 billion in 2021 for the rights and equipment to build the canal _ _
_ _ critics charged that an american investor syndicate allegedly divided the large payment among themselves _ _
_ _ there was also controversy over whether a french company engineer influenced roosevelt in choosing the panama route for the canal over the nicaragua route _ _
_ _ roosevelt denied charges of corruption concerning the canal in a january 8 1906 message to congress _ _
_ _ in january 1909 roosevelt in an unprecedented move brought criminal libel charges against the new york world and the indianapolis news known as the rooseveltpanama libel cases _ _
_ _ both cases were dismissed by us district courts and on january 3 1911 the us supreme court upon federal appeal upheld the lower courts rulings _ _
_ _ historians are sharply critical of roosevelts criminal prosecutions of the world and the news but are divided on whether actual corruption in acquiring and building the panama canal took place _ _
_ _ in 1906 following a disputed election an insurrection ensued in cuba roosevelt sent taft the secretary of war to monitor the situation he was convinced that he had the authority to unilaterally authorize taft to deploy marines if necessary without congressional approval _ _
_ _ examining the work of numerous scholars ricard 2014 reports that _ _
_ _ the most striking evolution in the twentyfirstcentury historiography of theodore roosevelt is the switch from a partial arraignment of the imperialist to a quasiunanimous celebration of the master diplomatist recent works have underlined cogently roosevelts exceptional statesmanship in the construction of the nascent twentiethcentury special relationship _ _
_ _ the twentysixth presidents reputation as a brilliant diplomatist and real politician has undeniably reached new heights in the twentyfirst centuryyet his philippine policy still prompts criticism _ _
_ _ building on mckinleys effective use of the press roosevelt made the white house the center of news every day providing interviews and photo opportunities _ _
_ _ after noticing the reporters huddled outside the white house in the rain one day he gave them their own room inside effectively inventing the presidential press briefing _ _
_ _ the grateful press with unprecedented access to the white house rewarded roosevelt with ample coverage _ _
_ _ roosevelt normally enjoyed very close relationships with the press which he used to keep in daily contact with his middleclass base _ _
_ _ while out of office he made a living as a writer and magazine editor _ _
_ _ he loved talking with intellectuals authors and writers _ _
_ _ he drew the line however at exposéoriented scandalmongering journalists who during his term sent magazine subscriptions soaring by their attacks on corrupt politicians mayors and corporations _ _
_ _ roosevelt himself was not usually a target but a speech of his from 1906 coined the term muckraker for unscrupulous journalists making wild charges _ _
_ _ the liar he said is no whit better than the thief and if his mendacity takes the form of slander he may be worse than most thieves _ _
_ _ the press did briefly target roosevelt in one instance _ _
_ _ after 1904 he was periodically criticized for the manner in which he facilitated the construction of the panama canal _ _
_ _ according to biographer brands roosevelt near the end of his term demanded that the us justice department bring charges of criminal libel against joseph pulitzers new york world _ _
_ _ the publication had accused him of deliberate misstatements of fact in defense of family members who were criticized as a result of the panama affair _ _
_ _ though an indictment was obtained the case was ultimately dismissed in federal court—it was not a federal offense but one enforceable in state courts _ _
_ _ the justice department had predicted that result and had also advised roosevelt accordingly _ _
_ _ the control and management of the republican party lay in the hands of ohio senator and republican party chairman mark hanna until mckinleys death _ _
_ _ roosevelt and hanna frequently cooperated during roosevelts first term but hanna left open the possibility of a challenge to roosevelt for the 1904 republican nomination _ _
_ _ roosevelt and ohios other senator joseph b foraker forced hannas hand by calling for ohios state republican convention to endorse roosevelt for the 1904 nomination _ _
_ _ unwilling to break with the president hanna was forced to publicly endorse roosevelt _ _
_ _ hanna and pennsylvania senator matthew quay both died in early 1904 and with the waning of thomas platts power roosevelt faced little effective opposition for the 1904 nomination _ _
_ _ in deference to hannas conservative loyalists roosevelt at first offered the party chairmanship to cornelius bliss but he declined _ _
_ _ roosevelt turned to his own man george b cortelyou of new york the first secretary of commerce and labor _ _
_ _ to buttress his hold on the partys nomination roosevelt made it clear that anyone opposing cortelyou would be considered to be opposing the president _ _
_ _ the president secured his own nomination but his preferred vicepresidential running mate robert r hitt was not nominated _ _
_ _ senator charles warren fairbanks of indiana a favorite of conservatives gained the nomination _ _
_ _ while roosevelt followed the tradition of incumbents in not actively campaigning on the stump he sought to control the campaigns message through specific instructions to cortelyou _ _
_ _ he also attempted to manage the presss release of white house statements by forming the ananias club _ _
_ _ any journalist who repeated a statement made by the president without approval was penalized by restriction of further access _ _
_ _ the democratic partys nominee in 1904 was alton brooks parker _ _
_ _ democratic newspapers charged that republicans were extorting large campaign contributions from corporations putting ultimate responsibility on roosevelt himself _ _
_ _ roosevelt denied corruption while at the same time he ordered cortelyou to return 100000 equivalent to 3 million in 2021 of a campaign contribution from standard oil _ _
_ _ parker said that roosevelt was accepting corporate donations to keep damaging information from the bureau of corporations from going public _ _
_ _ roosevelt strongly denied parkers charge and responded that he would go into the presidency unhampered by any pledge promise or understanding of any kind sort or description _ _
_ _ allegations from parker and the democrats however had little impact on the election as roosevelt promised to give every american a square deal _ _
_ _ roosevelt won 56 of the popular vote and parker received 38 roosevelt also won the electoral college vote 336 to 140 _ _
_ _ before his inauguration ceremony roosevelt declared that he would not serve another term _ _
_ _ democrats afterwards would continue to charge roosevelt and the republicans of being influenced by corporate donations during roosevelts second term _ _
_ _ as his second term progressed roosevelt moved to the left of his republican party base and called for a series of reforms most of which congress failed to pass _ _
_ _ in his last year in office he was assisted by his friend archibald butt who later perished in the sinking of rms titanic _ _
_ _ roosevelts influence waned as he approached the end of his second term as his promise to forego a third term made him a lame duck and his concentration of power provoked a backlash from many congressmen _ _
_ _ he sought a national incorporation law at a time when all corporations had state charters called for a federal income tax despite the supreme courts ruling in pollock v farmers loan  trust co and an inheritance tax _ _
_ _ in the area of labor legislation roosevelt called for limits on the use of court injunctions against labor unions during strikes injunctions were a powerful weapon that mostly helped business _ _
_ _ he wanted an employee liability law for industrial injuries preempting state laws and an eighthour work day for federal employees _ _
_ _ in other areas he also sought a postal savings system to provide competition for local banks and he asked for campaign reform laws _ _
_ _ the election of 1904 continued to be a source of contention between republicans and democrats _ _
_ _ a congressional investigation in 1905 revealed that corporate executives donated tens of thousands of dollars in 1904 to the republican national committee _ _
_ _ in 1908 a month before the general presidential election governor charles n haskell of oklahoma former democratic treasurer said that senators beholden to standard oil lobbied roosevelt in the summer of 1904 to authorize the leasing of indian oil lands by standard oil subsidiaries _ _
_ _ he said roosevelt overruled his secretary of the interior ethan a hitchcock and granted a pipeline franchise to run through the osage lands to the prairie oil and gas company _ _
_ _ the new york sun made a similar accusation and said that standard oil a refinery who financially benefited from the pipeline had contributed 150000 to the republicans in 1904 equivalent to 45 million in 2021 after roosevelts alleged reversal allowing the pipeline franchise _ _
_ _ roosevelt branded haskells allegation as a lie pure and simple and obtained a denial from treasury secretary shaw that roosevelt had neither coerced shaw nor overruled him _ _
_ _ roosevelt enjoyed being president and was still relatively youthful but felt that a limited number of terms provided a check against dictatorship _ _
_ _ roosevelt ultimately decided to stick to his 1904 pledge not to run for a third term _ _
_ _ he personally favored secretary of state elihu root as his successor but roots ill health made him an unsuitable candidate _ _
_ _ new york governor charles evans hughes loomed as a potentially strong candidate and shared roosevelts progressivism but roosevelt disliked him and considered him to be too independent _ _
_ _ instead roosevelt settled on his secretary of war william howard taft who had ably served under presidents harrison mckinley and roosevelt in various positions _ _
_ _ roosevelt and taft had been friends since 1890 and taft had consistently supported president roosevelts policies _ _
_ _ roosevelt was determined to install the successor of his choice and wrote the following to taft dear will do you want any action about those federal officials _ _
_ _ i will break their necks with the utmost cheerfulness if you say the word _ _
_ _ just weeks later he branded as false and malicious the charge that he was using the offices at his disposal to favor taft _ _
_ _ at the 1908 republican convention many chanted for four years more of a roosevelt presidency but taft won the nomination after henry cabot lodge made it clear that roosevelt was not interested in a third term _ _
_ _ in the 1908 election taft easily defeated the democratic nominee threetime candidate william jennings bryan _ _
_ _ taft promoted a progressivism that stressed the rule of law he preferred that judges rather than administrators or politicians make the basic decisions about fairness _ _
_ _ taft usually proved to be a less adroit politician than roosevelt and lacked the energy and personal magnetism along with the publicity devices the dedicated supporters and the broad base of public support that made roosevelt so formidable _ _
_ _ when roosevelt realized that lowering the tariff would risk creating severe tensions inside the republican party by pitting producers manufacturers industrial workers and farmers against merchants and consumers he stopped talking about the issue _ _
_ _ taft ignored the risks and tackled the tariff boldly encouraging reformers to fight for lower rates and then cutting deals with conservative leaders that kept overall rates high _ _
_ _ the resulting paynealdrich tariff of 1909 signed into law early in president tafts tenure was too high for most reformers and tafts handling of the tariff alienated all sides _ _
_ _ while the crisis was building inside the party roosevelt was touring africa and europe to allow taft space to be his own man _ _
_ _ in march 1909 the expresident left the country for the smithsonianroosevelt african expedition a safari in east and central africa _ _
_ _ roosevelts party landed in mombasa east africa now kenya and traveled to the belgian congo now democratic republic of the congo before following the nile river to khartoum in modern sudan _ _
_ _ wellfinanced by andrew carnegie and by his own writings roosevelts large party hunted for specimens for the smithsonian institution and for the american museum of natural history in new york _ _
_ _ the group led by the huntertracker rj cunninghame included scientists from the smithsonian and was joined from time to time by frederick selous the famous big game hunter and explorer _ _
_ _ participants on the expedition included kermit roosevelt edgar alexander mearns edmund heller and john alden loring _ _
_ _ the team killed or trapped 11400 animals from insects and moles to hippopotamuses and elephants _ _
_ _ the 1000 large animals included 512 big game animals including six rare white rhinos _ _
_ _ tons of salted carcases and skins were shipped to washington it took years to mount them all and the smithsonian shared duplicate specimens with other museums _ _
_ _ regarding the large number of animals taken roosevelt said i can be condemned only if the existence of the national museum the american museum of natural history and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned _ _
_ _ he wrote a detailed account of the safari in the book african game trails recounting the excitement of the chase the people he met and the flora and fauna he collected in the name of science _ _
_ _ after his safari roosevelt traveled north to embark on a tour of europe _ _
_ _ stopping first in egypt he commented favorably on british rule of the region giving his opinion that egypt was not yet ready for independence _ _

_ _ he also delivered the romanes lecture at oxford in which he denounced those who sought parallels between the evolution of animal life and the development of society _ _
_ _ though roosevelt attempted to avoid domestic politics he quietly met with gifford pinchot who related his own disappointment with the taft administration _ _
_ _ pinchot had been forced to resign as head of the forest service after clashing with tafts interior secretary richard ballinger who had prioritized development over conservation _ _

_ _ roosevelt had attempted to refashion taft into a copy of himself but he recoiled as taft began to display his individuality _ _
_ _ he was offended on election night when taft indicated that his success had been possible not just through the efforts of roosevelt but also his halfbrother charles _ _
_ _ roosevelt was further alienated when taft intent on becoming his own man did not consult him about cabinet appointments _ _
_ _ roosevelt and other progressives were ideologically dissatisfied over tafts conservation policies and his handling of the tariff when he concentrated more power in the hands of conservative party leaders in congress _ _
_ _ stanley solvick argues that as president taft abided by the goals and procedures of the square deal promoted by roosevelt in his first term _ _
_ _ the problem was that roosevelt and the more radical progressives had moved on to more aggressive goals such as curbing the judiciary which taft rejected _ _
_ _ regarding radicalism and liberalism roosevelt wrote a british friend in 1911 _ _
_ _ roosevelt urged progressives to take control of the republican party at the state and local level and to avoid splitting the party in a way that would hand the presidency to the democrats in 1912 _ _
_ _ to that end roosevelt publicly expressed optimism about the taft administration after meeting with the president in june 1910 _ _
_ _ in august 1910 roosevelt escalated the rivalry with a speech at osawatomie kansas which was the most radical of his career _ _

_ _ he called for a ban on corporate political contributions _ _
_ _ returning to new york roosevelt began a battle to take control of the state republican party from william barnes jr tom platts successor as the state party boss _ _
_ _ taft had pledged his support to roosevelt in this endeavor and roosevelt was outraged when tafts support failed to materialize at the 1910 state convention _ _
_ _ roosevelt campaigned for the republicans in the 1910 elections in which the democrats gained control of the house for the first time since 1892 _ _
_ _ among the newly elected democrats was new york state senator franklin delano roosevelt who argued that he represented his distant cousins policies better than his republican opponent _ _
_ _ the republican progressives interpreted the 1910 defeats as a compelling argument for the complete reorganization of the party in 1911 _ _
_ _ senator robert m la follette of wisconsin joined with pinchot william white and california governor hiram johnson to create the national progressive republican league their objectives were to defeat the power of political bossism at the state level and to replace taft at the national level _ _
_ _ despite his skepticism of la follettes new league roosevelt expressed general support for progressive principles _ _
_ _ between january and april 1911 roosevelt wrote a series of articles for the outlook defending what he called the great movement of our day the progressive nationalist movement against special privilege and in favor of an honest and efficient political and industrial democracy _ _
_ _ with roosevelt apparently uninterested in running in 1912 la follette declared his own candidacy in june 1911 _ _
_ _ roosevelt continually criticized taft after the 1910 elections and the break between the two men became final after the justice department filed an antitrust lawsuit against us steel in september 1911 roosevelt was humiliated by this suit because he had personally approved of an acquisition that the justice department was now challenging _ _
_ _ however roosevelt was still unwilling to run against taft in 1912 he instead hoped to run in 1916 against whichever democrat beat taft in 1912 _ _
_ _ taft was world leader for arbitration as a guarantee of world peace _ _
_ _ in 1911 he and his secretary of state philander c knox negotiated major treaties with great britain and france providing that differences be arbitrated _ _
_ _ disputes had to be submitted to the hague court or other tribunal _ _
_ _ these were signed in august 1911 but had to be ratified by a twothirds vote of the senate _ _
_ _ neither taft or knox consulted with leaders of the senate during the negotiating process _ _
_ _ by then many republicans were opposed to taft and the president felt that lobbying too hard for the treaties might cause their defeat _ _
_ _ he made some speeches supporting the treaties in october but the senate added amendments taft could not accept killing the agreements _ _
_ _ the arbitration issue revealed a deep philosophical dispute among american progressives _ _
_ _ one faction led by taft looked to legal arbitration as the best alternative to warfare _ _
_ _ taft was a constitutional lawyer with a deep understanding of the legal issues _ _
_ _ tafts political base was the conservative business community that largely supported peace movements before 1914 _ _
_ _ however he failed to mobilize that base _ _
_ _ the businessmen believed that economic rivalries were the cause of war and that extensive trade led to an interdependent world that would make war a very expensive and useless anachronism _ _
_ _ however an opposing faction of progressives led by roosevelt ridiculed arbitration as foolhardy idealism and insisted on the realism of warfare as the only solution to serious international disputes _ _
_ _ roosevelt worked with his close friend senator henry cabot lodge to impose those amendments that ruined the goals of the treaties _ _
_ _ lodges motivation was that he  complained the treaties impinged too much on senatorial prerogatives _ _
_ _ roosevelt however was acting to sabotage tafts campaign promises _ _
_ _ at a deeper level roosevelt truly believed that arbitration was a naïve solution and the great issues had to be decided by warfare _ _
_ _ the rooseveltian approach incorporated a nearmystical faith of the ennobling nature of war _ _
_ _ it endorsed jingoistic nationalism as opposed to the businessmens calculation of profit and national interest _ _
_ _ in november 1911 a group of ohio republicans endorsed roosevelt for the partys nomination for president the endorsers included james r garfield and dan hanna _ _
_ _ this endorsement was made by leaders of president tafts home state _ _
_ _ roosevelt conspicuously declined to make a statement—requested by garfield—that he would flatly refuse a nomination _ _
_ _ soon thereafter roosevelt said i am really sorry for taft _ _
_ _ i am sure he means well but he means well feebly and he does not know how _ _
_ _ he is utterly unfit for leadership and this is a time when we need leadership _ _
_ _ in january 1912 roosevelt declared if the people make a draft on me i shall not decline to serve _ _
_ _ later that year roosevelt spoke before the constitutional convention in ohio openly identifying as a progressive and endorsing progressive reforms—even endorsing popular review of state judicial decisions _ _
_ _ in reaction to roosevelts proposals for popular overrule of court decisions taft said such extremists are not progressives—they are political emotionalists or neurotics _ _
_ _ roosevelt began to envision himself as the savior of the republican party from defeat in the upcoming presidential election _ _
_ _ in february 1912 roosevelt announced in boston i will accept the nomination for president if it is tendered to me _ _
_ _ i hope that so far as possible the people may be given the chance through direct primaries to express who shall be the nominee _ _
_ _ elihu root and henry cabot lodge thought that division of the party would lead to its defeat in the next election while taft believed that he would be defeated either in the republican primary or in the general election _ _
_ _ the 1912 primaries represented the first extensive use of the presidential primary a reform achievement of the progressive movement _ _
_ _ the republican primaries in the south where party regulars dominated went for taft as did results in new york indiana michigan kentucky and massachusetts _ _
_ _ meanwhile roosevelt won in illinois minnesota nebraska south dakota california maryland and pennsylvania _ _
_ _ the greatest primary fight came in ohio tafts base _ _
_ _ both the taft and roosevelt campaigns worked furiously and la follette joined in _ _
_ _ each team sent in big name speakers _ _
_ _ roosevelts train went 1800 miles back and forth in the one state where he made 75 speeches _ _
_ _ tafts train went 3000 miles crisscrossing ohio and he made over 100 speechesroosevelt swept the state convincing roosevelt that he should intensify his campaigning and letting taft know he should work from the white house not the stump _ _
_ _ only a third of the states held primaries elsewhere the state organization chose the delegations to the national convention and they favored taft _ _
_ _ the final credentials of the state delegates at the national convention were determined by the national committee which was controlled by taft men _ _
_ _ prior to the 1912 republican national convention in chicago roosevelt expressed doubt about his prospects for victory noting that taft had more delegates and control of the credentials committee _ _
_ _ his only hope was to convince party leaders that the nomination of taft would hand the election to the democrats but party leaders were determined not to cede their leadership to roosevelt _ _
_ _ the credentials committee awarded 235 contested delegates to taft and 19 to roosevelt _ _
_ _ taft won the nomination on the first ballot with 561 votes against 107 for roosevelt and 41 for la follette _ _
_ _ of the roosevelt delegates 344 refused to vote so they would not be committed to the republican ticket _ _
_ _ black delegates from the south played a key role they voted heavily for taft and put him over the top _ _
_ _ la follette hoped that a deadlocked convention would result in his own nomination and refused to release his delegates to support roosevelt _ _
_ _ according to lewis l gould in 1912 _ _
_ _ roosevelt saw taft as the agent of the forces of reaction and of political crookedness roosevelt had become the most dangerous man in american history said taft because of his hold upon the less intelligent voters and the discontented _ _
_ _ the republican national committee dominated by the taft forces awarded 235 delegates to the president and 19 to roosevelt thereby ensuring tafts renomination _ _
_ _ roosevelt believed himself entitled to 72 delegates from arizona california texas and washington that had been given to taft _ _
_ _ firm in his conviction that the nomination was being stolen from him roosevelt told cheering supporters that there was a great moral issue at stake and he should have sixty to eighty lawfully elected delegates added to his totalroosevelt ended his speech declaring fearless of the future unheeding of our individual fates with unflinching hearts and undimmed eyes we stand at armageddon and we battle for the lord _ _
_ _ once his defeat at the republican convention appeared probable roosevelt announced that he would accept the progressive nomination on a progressive platform and i shall fight to the end win or lose _ _
_ _ at the same time roosevelt prophetically said my feeling is that the democrats will probably win if they nominate a progressive _ _
_ _ roosevelt left the republican party and created the progressive party structuring it as a permanent organization that would field complete tickets at the presidential and state level _ _
_ _ the new party included many reformers including jane addams _ _
_ _ although many republican politicians had announced for roosevelt before taft won the nomination he was stunned to discover that very few incumbent politicians followed him into the new party _ _
_ _ the main exception was california where the progressive faction took control of the republican party _ _
_ _ loyalty to the old party was a powerful factor for incumbents only five senators now supported roosevelt _ _
_ _ roosevelts daughter alice had a white house marriage to congressman nicholas longworth who represented tafts base in cincinnati _ _
_ _ roosevelt reassured him in 1912 that of course he had to endorse taft _ _
_ _ however alice was her fathers biggest cheerleader—the public conflict between spouses ruined the marriage _ _
_ _ the leadership of the new party included a wide range of reformers _ _
_ _ jane addams campaigned vigorously for the new party as a breakthrough in social reform _ _
_ _ gifford pinchot represented the enviromentalists and antitrust crusaders _ _
_ _ publisher frank munsey provided much of the cash _ _
_ _ george w perkins a leading wall street financier and senior partner of jp morgan bank came from the efficiency movement _ _
_ _ he handled the new partys finances efficiently but was deeply distrusted by many reformers _ _
_ _ the new party was popularly known as the bull moose party after roosevelt told reporters im as fit as a bull moose _ _
_ _ at the 1912 progressive national convention roosevelt cried out we stand at armageddon and we battle for the lord _ _
_ _ governor hiram johnson controlled the california party forcing out the taft supporters _ _
_ _ he was nominated as roosevelts running mate _ _
_ _ roosevelts platform echoed his radical 1907–1908 proposals calling for vigorous government intervention to protect the people from selfish interests _ _
_ _ to destroy this invisible government to dissolve the unholy alliance between corrupt business and corrupt politics is the first task of the statesmanship of the day _ _
_ _ this country belongs to the people _ _
_ _ its resources its business its laws its institutions should be utilized maintained or altered in whatever manner will best promote the general interest _ _
_ _ this assertion is explicit mr wilson must know that every monopoly in the united states opposes the progressive party _ _
_ _ i challenge him to name the monopoly that did support the progressive party whether the sugar trust the us steel trust the harvester trust the standard oil trust the tobacco trust or any other _ _
_ _ ours was the only program to which they objected and they supported either mr wilson or mr _ _
_ _ taft _ _
_ _ though many progressive party activists in the north opposed the steady loss of civil rights for blacks roosevelt ran a lilywhite campaign in the south _ _
_ _ rival allwhite and allblack delegations from four southern states arrived at the progressive national convention and roosevelt decided to seat the allwhite delegations _ _
_ _ nevertheless he won few votes outside a few traditional republican strongholds _ _
_ _ out of 1100 counties in the south roosevelt won two counties in alabama one in arkansas seven in north carolina three in georgia 17 in tennessee two in texas one in virginia and none in florida louisiana mississippi or south carolina _ _
_ _ on october 14 1912 while arriving at a campaign event in milwaukee wisconsin roosevelt was shot from seven feet away in front of the gilpatrick hotel by a delusional saloonkeeper named john flammang schrank who believed that the ghost of assassinated president william mckinley had directed him to kill roosevelt _ _
_ _ the bullet lodged in his chest after penetrating his steel eyeglass case and passing through a 50pagethick singlefolded copy of the speech titled progressive cause greater than any individual which he was carrying in his jacket _ _
_ _ schrank was immediately disarmed by czech immigrant frank bukovsky captured and might have been lynched had roosevelt not shouted for schrank to remain unharmed _ _
_ _ roosevelt assured the crowd he was all right then ordered police to take charge of schrank and to make sure no violence was done to him _ _
_ _ as an experienced hunter and anatomist roosevelt correctly concluded that since he was not coughing blood the bullet had not reached his lung _ _
_ _ he declined suggestions to go to the hospital immediately and instead delivered a 90 minute speech with blood seeping into his shirt _ _
_ _ unreliable source _ _
_ _ his opening comments to the gathered crowd were ladies and gentlemen i dont know whether you fully understand that i have just been shot but it takes more than that to kill a bull moose _ _
_ _ unreliable source _ _
_ _ only after finishing his address did he accept medical attention _ _
_ _ subsequent probes and an xray showed that the bullet had lodged in roosevelts chest muscle but did not penetrate the pleura _ _
_ _ doctors concluded that it would be less dangerous to leave it in place than to attempt to remove it and roosevelt carried the bullet with him for the rest of his life _ _
_ _ both taft and democratic nominee woodrow wilson suspended their own campaigning until roosevelt recovered and resumed his _ _
_ _ when asked if the shooting would affect his election campaign he said to the reporter im fit as a bull moose _ _
_ _ the bull moose became a symbol of both roosevelt and the progressive party and it often was referred to as simply the bull moose party _ _
_ _ he spent two weeks recuperating before returning to the campaign trail _ _
_ _ he later wrote a friend about the bullet inside him i do not mind it any more than if it were in my waistcoat pocket _ _
_ _ on october 20 roosevelt spoke to a crowd of 16000 at madison square garden _ _
_ _ the speech included perhaps once in a generation there comes a chance for the people of a country to play their part wisely and fearlessly in some great battle of the agelong warfare for human rights _ _
_ _ after the democrats nominated governor woodrow wilson of new jersey roosevelt did not expect to win the general election as wilson had compiled a record attractive to many progressive democrats who might have otherwise considered voting for roosevelt _ _
_ _ roosevelt still campaigned vigorously and the election developed into a twoperson contest despite tafts quiet presence in the race _ _
_ _ roosevelt respected wilson but the two differed on various issues wilson opposed any federal intervention regarding womens suffrage or child labor he viewed these as state issues and attacked roosevelts tolerance of large businesses _ _
_ _ roosevelt won 41 million votes 27 compared to tafts 35 million 23 and wilsons gained 63 million 42 _ _
_ _ wilson scored a massive landslide in the electoral college with 435 electoral votes roosevelt won 88 electoral votes while taft won 8 _ _

_ _ roosevelts popular book through the brazilian wilderness describes his expedition into the brazilian jungle in 1913 as a member of the rooseveltrondon scientific expedition conamed after its leader brazilian explorer cândido rondon _ _
_ _ once in south america a new far more ambitious goal was added to find the headwaters of the rio da duvida portuguese for river of doubt and trace it north to the madeira and thence to the amazon river _ _
_ _ it was later renamed roosevelt river in honor of the former president _ _
_ _ roosevelts crew consisted of his son kermit colonel rondon naturalist george kruck cherrie sent by the american museum of natural history brazilian lieutenant joão lira team physician dr josé antonio cajazeira and 16 skilled paddlers and porters _ _
_ _ roosevelt also identified leo miller another amnh recommendation anthony fiala frank harper and jacob sigg as crew members _ _
_ _ the initial expedition started somewhat tenuously on december 9 1913 at the height of the rainy season _ _
_ _ the trip down the river of doubt started on february 27 1914 _ _
_ _ during the trip down the river roosevelt suffered a minor leg wound after he jumped into the river to try to prevent two canoes from smashing against the rocks _ _
_ _ the flesh wound he received however soon gave him tropical fever that resembled the malaria he had contracted while in cuba fifteen years before _ _
_ _ because the bullet lodged in his chest from the assassination attempt in 1912 was never removed his health worsened from the infection _ _
_ _ this weakened roosevelt so greatly that six weeks into the adventure he had to be attended to day and night by the expeditions physician and his son kermit _ _
_ _ by then he could not walk because of the infection in his injured leg and an infirmity in the other which was due to a traffic accident a decade earlier _ _
_ _ roosevelt was riddled with chest pains fighting a fever that soared to 103 °f 39 °c and at times made him delirious at one point constantly reciting the first two lines of samuel taylor coleridges poem kubla khan in xanadu did kubla khan  a stately pleasure dome decree _ _
_ _ regarding his condition as a threat to the survival of the others roosevelt insisted he be left behind to allow the poorly provisioned expedition to proceed as rapidly as it could preparing to commit suicide with an overdose of morphine _ _
_ _ only an appeal by his son persuaded him to continue _ _
_ _ despite roosevelts continued decline and loss of over 50 pounds 23 kg colonel rondon reduced the pace of the expedition to allow for his commissions mapmaking and other geographical tasks which required regular stops to fix the expeditions position by sunbased survey _ _
_ _ upon roosevelts return to new york friends and family were startled by his physical appearance and fatigue _ _
_ _ roosevelt wrote perhaps prophetically to a friend that the trip had cut his life short by ten years _ _
_ _ for the rest of his few remaining years he would be plagued by flareups of malaria and leg inflammations so severe as to require surgery _ _
_ _ before roosevelt had even completed his sea voyage home critics raised doubts over his claims of exploring and navigating a completely uncharted river over 625 miles 1006 km long _ _

_ _ roosevelt returned to the united states in may 1914 _ _

_ _ roosevelt made several campaign appearances for the progressives but the 1914 elections were a disaster for the fledgling third party _ _

_ _ in hopes of engineering a joint nomination the progressives scheduled the 1916 progressive national convention at the same time as the 1916 republican national convention _ _
_ _ when the republicans nominated charles evans hughes roosevelt declined the progressive nomination and urged his progressive followers to support the republican candidate _ _
_ _ though roosevelt had long disliked hughes he disliked wilson even more and he campaigned energetically for the republican nominee _ _
_ _ however wilson won the 1916 election by a narrow margin _ _
_ _ the progressives disappeared as a party following the 1916 election and roosevelt and many of his followers permanently rejoined the republican party _ _
_ _ when the first world war began in 1914 roosevelt strongly supported the allies and demanded a harsher policy against germany especially regarding submarine warfare _ _
_ _ roosevelt angrily denounced the foreign policy of president wilson calling it a failure regarding the atrocities in belgium and the violations of american rights _ _
_ _ in 1916 while campaigning for hughes roosevelt repeatedly denounced irishamericans and germanamericans whom he described as unpatriotic saying they put the interests of ireland and germany ahead of americas by supporting neutrality _ _
_ _ he insisted that one had to be 100 american not a hyphenated american who juggled multiple loyalties _ _
_ _ in march 1917 congress gave roosevelt the authority to raise a maximum of four divisions similar to the rough riders and major frederick russell burnham was put in charge of both the general organization and recruitment _ _
_ _ however president wilson announced to the press that he would not send roosevelt and his volunteers to france but instead would send an american expeditionary force under the command of general john j _ _

_ _ it would have executive power such as the hague conventions of 1899 and 1907 lacked _ _
_ _ he called for american participation _ _
_ _ when world war i broke out roosevelt proposed a world league for the peace of righteousness in september 1914 which would preserve sovereignty but limit armaments and require arbitration _ _
_ _ he added that it should be solemnly covenanted that if any nations refused to abide by the decisions of such a court then others draw the sword in behalf of peace and justice _ _
_ _ in 1915 he outlined this plan more specifically urging that nations guarantee their entire military force if necessary against any nation that refused to carry out arbitration decrees or violated rights of other nations _ _
_ _ though roosevelt had some concerns about the impact on united states sovereignty he insisted that such a league would only work if the united states participated as one of the joint guarantors _ _
_ _ roosevelt referred to this plan in a 1918 speech as the most feasible fora league of nations _ _
_ _ by this time wilson was strongly hostile to roosevelt and lodge and developed his own plans for a rather different league of nations _ _
_ _ it became reality along wilsons lines at the paris peace conference in 1919 _ _
_ _ roosevelt denounced wilsons approach but died before it was adopted at paris _ _
_ _ however lodge was willing to accept it with serious reservations _ _
_ _ in the end on march 19 1920 wilson had democratic senators vote against the league with the lodge reservations and the united states never joined the league of nations _ _
_ _ roosevelts attacks on wilson helped the republicans win control of congress in the midterm elections of 1918 _ _
_ _ he declined a request from new york republicans to run for another gubernatorial term but attacked wilsons fourteen points calling instead for the unconditional surrender of germany _ _
_ _ though his health was uncertain he was seen as a leading contender for the 1920 republican nomination but insisted that if they take me theyll have to take me without a single modification of the things that i have always stood for _ _
_ _ he wrote william allen white i wish to do everything in my power to make the republican party the party of sane constructive radicalism just as it was under lincoln _ _

_ _ he was suspicious of mormons until they renounced polygamy _ _
_ _ in 1907 concerning the proposed motto in god we trust on money he wrote it seems to me eminently unwise to cheapen such a motto by use on coins just as it would be to cheapen it by use on postage stamps or in advertisements _ _
_ _ roosevelt talked a great deal about religion _ _
_ _ biographer edmund morris states _ _
_ _ when consoling bereaved people he would awkwardly invoke unseen and unknown powers _ _
_ _ aside from a few clichés of protestant rhetoric the gospel he preached had always been political and pragmatic _ _

_ _ every thinking man when he thinks realizes what a very large number of people tend to forget that the teachings of the bible are so interwoven and entwined with our whole civic and social life that it would be literally—i do not mean figuratively i mean literally—impossible for us to figure to ourselves what that life would be if these teachings were removed _ _
_ _ we would lose almost all the standards by which we now judge both public and private morals all the standards toward which we with more or less of resolution strive to raise ourselves _ _
_ _ almost every man who has by his lifework added to the sum of human achievement of which the race is proud has based his lifework largely upon the teachings of the bible _ _

_ _ roosevelt sought to replace the 19thcentury laissezfaire economic environment with a new economic model which included a larger regulatory role for the federal government _ _
_ _ he believed that 19thcentury entrepreneurs had risked their fortunes on innovations and new businesses and that these capitalists had been rightly rewarded _ _
_ _ by contrast he believed that 20thcentury capitalists risked little but nonetheless reaped huge and given the lack of risk unjust economic rewards _ _
_ _ without a redistribution of wealth away from the upper class roosevelt feared that the country would turn to radicals or fall to revolution _ _
_ _ his square deal domestic program had three main goals conservation of natural resources control of corporations and consumer protection _ _

_ _ roosevelt trained in biology was a social darwinist who believed in survival of the fittest _ _
_ _ the international world in his view was a realm of violence and conflict _ _
_ _ the united states had  all the economic and geographical potential to be the fittest nation on the globe _ _
_ _ the united states had a duty to act decisively _ _
_ _ for example in terms of the monroe doctrine america had to prevent european incursions in the western hemisphere _ _
_ _ but there was more as he expressed in his famous roosevelt corollary to the monroe doctrine the us had to be the policeman of the region because unruly corrupt smaller nations had to be controlled and if united states did not do it european powers would in fact intervene and develop their own base of power in the hemisphere in contravention to the monroe doctrine _ _

_ _ he ridiculed disarmament proposals that were increasingly common _ _
_ _ he saw no likelihood of an international power capable of checking wrongdoing on a major scale _ _
_ _ as for world government _ _
_ _ i regard the wilson–bryan attitude of trusting to fantastic peace treaties too impossible promises to all kinds of scraps of paper without any backing in efficient force as abhorrent _ _
_ _ it is infinitely better for a nation and for the world to have the frederick the great and bismarck tradition as regards foreign policy than to have the bryan or bryan–wilson attitude as a permanent national attitude a milkandwater righteousness unbacked by force isas wicked as and even more mischievous than force divorced from righteousness _ _
_ _ on his international outlook roosevelt favored spheres of influence whereby one great power would generally prevail such as the united states in the western hemisphere or great britain in the indian subcontinent _ _
_ _ japan fit that role and he approved _ _
_ _ however he had deep distrust of both germany and russia _ _
_ _ historians credit roosevelt for changing the nations political system by permanently placing the bully pulpit of the presidency at center stage and making character as important as the issues _ _
_ _ his accomplishments include trust busting and conservationism _ _
_ _ he is a hero to liberals and progressives for his proposals in 1907–1912 that presaged the modern welfare state of the new deal era including direct federal taxation labor reforms and more direct democracy while conservationists admire roosevelt for putting the environment and selflessness towards future generations on the national agenda and conservatives and nationalists respect his commitment to law and order civic duty and military values as well as his personality of individual selfresponsibility and hardiness _ _

_ _ roosevelts biographers have stressed his personality _ _
_ _ henry f pringle who won the pulitzer prize in biography for his theodore roosevelt 1931 stated the theodore roosevelt of later years was the most adolescent of men failure to receive the medal of honor for his exploits in cuba had been a grief as real as any of those which swamp childhood in despair _ _

_ _ brands calls roosevelt the last romantic arguing that his romantic concept of life emerged from his belief that physical bravery was the highest virtue and war the ultimate test of bravery _ _
_ _ roosevelt as the exemplar of american masculinity has become a major theme _ _
_ _ as president he repeatedly warned men that they were becoming too officebound too complacent too comfortable with physical ease and moral laxity and were failing in their duties to propagate the race and exhibit masculine vigor _ _
_ _ french historian serge ricard says the ebullient apostle of the strenuous life offers ideal material for a detailed psychohistorical analysis of aggressive manhood in the changing sociocultural environment of his era mckinley taft or wilson would perhaps inadequately serve that purpose _ _
_ _ he promoted competitive sports like boxing and jiujitsu for physically strengthening american men _ _
_ _ he also believed that organizations like the boy scouts of america founded in 1910 could help mold and strengthen the character of american boys _ _
_ _ brands shows that heroic displays of bravery were essential to roosevelts image and mission _ _
_ _ what makes the hero a hero is the romantic notion that he stands above the tawdry give and take of everyday politics occupying an ethereal realm where partisanship gives way to patriotism and division to unity and where the nation regains its lost innocence and the people their shared sense of purpose _ _
_ _ according to david nasaw after 1898 when the united states entered a war with spain industrialist andrew carnegie increasingly devoted his energy to supporting pacifism _ _
_ _ he sold his steel company and now had the time and the dollars to make an impact _ _
_ _ carnegie strongly opposed the war with spain and the subsequent imperialistic american takeover of the philippines _ _

_ _ they exchanged letters communicated through mutual friends such as secretary of state john hay and met in person _ _
_ _ carnegie offered a steady stream of advice on foreign policy especially on arbitration _ _
_ _ carnegie hoped that roosevelt would turn the philippines free not realizing he was more of an imperialist and believer in warrior virtues than president mckinley had been _ _

_ _ roosevelt relied on carnegie for financing his expedition to africa in 1909 _ _
_ _ in return he asked the expresident to mediate the growing conflict between the two cousins who ruled britain and germany _ _
_ _ roosevelt started to do so but the scheme collapsed when king edward vii suddenly died _ _
_ _ nasaw argues that roosevelt systematically deceived and manipulated carnegie and held the elderly man in contempt _ _
_ _ nasaw quotes a private letter roosevelt wrote to whitelaw reid in 1905 _ _
_ _ i have tried hard to like carnegie but it is pretty difficult _ _
_ _ there is no type of man for whom i feel a more contemptuous abhorrence than for the one who makes a god of mere moneymaking and at the same time is always yelling out that kind of utterly stupid condemnation of war which in almost every case springs from a combination of defective physical courage of unmanly shrinking from pain and effort and of hopelessly twisted ideals _ _
_ _ all the suffering from spanish war comes far short of the suffering preventable and nonpreventable among the operators of the carnegie steel works and among the small investors during the time that carnegie was making his fortuneit is as noxious folly to denounce war per se as it is to denounce business per se _ _
_ _ unrighteous war is a hideous evil but i am not at all sure that it is worse evil than business unrighteousness _ _

_ _ for his gallantry at san juan hill roosevelts commanders recommended him for the medal of honor _ _
_ _ however the initial recommendation lacked any eyewitnesses and the effort was eventually tainted by roosevelts own lobbying of the war department _ _
_ _ in the late 1990s roosevelts supporters again recommended the award which was denied by the secretary of the army on basis that the decorations board determined roosevelts bravery in battle did not rise to the level that would justify the medal of honor and indeed it did not rise to the level of men who fought in that engagement _ _
