_ _ hamiltons federalists exploited large loans to gain control of us debt securities causing a run on the national bank the markets returned to normal by midapril _ _
_ _ jefferson believed hamilton was part of the scheme despite hamiltons efforts to ameliorate and washington again found himself in the middle of a feud _ _
_ _ jefferson and hamilton adopted diametrically opposed political principles _ _

_ _ on august 7 washington issued his first proclamation for calling up state militias _ _
_ _ after appealing for peace he reminded the protestors that unlike the rule of the british crown the federal law was issued by stateelected representatives _ _
_ _ threats and violence against tax collectors however escalated into defiance against federal authority in 1794 and gave rise to the whiskey rebellion _ _
_ _ washington issued a final proclamation on september 25 threatening the use of military force to no avail _ _
_ _ the federal army was not up to the task so washington invoked the militia act of 1792 to summon state militias _ _

_ _ they took 150 prisoners and the remaining rebels dispersed without further fighting _ _
_ _ two of the prisoners were condemned to death but washington exercised his constitutional authority for the first time and pardoned them _ _

_ _ ron chernow describes washington as always trying to be evenhanded in dealing with the natives _ _
_ _ he states that washington hoped they would abandon their itinerant hunting life and adapt to fixed agricultural communities in the manner of white settlers _ _
_ _ he also maintains that washington never advocated outright confiscation of tribal land or the forcible removal of tribes and that he berated american settlers who abused natives admitting that he held out no hope for pacific relations with the natives as long as frontier settlers entertain the opinion that there is not the same crime or indeed no crime at all in killing a native as in killing a white man _ _
_ _ by contrast colin g calloway writes that washington had a lifelong obsession with getting indian land either for himself or for his nation and initiated policies and campaigns that had devastating effects in indian country _ _
_ _ the growth of the nation galloway has stated demanded the dispossession of indian people _ _
_ _ washington hoped the process could be bloodless and that indian people would give up their lands for a fair price and move away _ _
_ _ but if indians refused and resisted as they often did he felt he had no choice but to extirpate them and that the expeditions he sent to destroy indian towns were therefore entirely justified _ _
_ _ during the fall of 1789 washington had to contend with the british refusing to evacuate their forts in the northwest frontier and their concerted efforts to incite hostile indian tribes to attack american settlers _ _
_ _ the northwest tribes under miami chief little turtle allied with the british army to resist american expansion and killed 1500 settlers between 1783 and 1790 _ _
_ _ as documented by harless 2018 washington declared that the government of the united states are determined that their administration of indian affairs shall be directed entirely by the great principles of justice and humanity and provided that treaties should negotiate their land interests _ _
_ _ the administration regarded powerful tribes as foreign nations and washington even smoked a peace pipe and drank wine with them at the philadelphia presidential house _ _
_ _ he made numerous attempts to conciliate them he equated killing indigenous peoples with killing whites and sought to integrate them into european american culture _ _
_ _ secretary of war henry knox also attempted to encourage agriculture among the tribes _ _
_ _ in the southwest negotiations failed between federal commissioners and raiding indian tribes seeking retribution _ _
_ _ washington invited creek chief alexander mcgillivray and 24 leading chiefs to new york to negotiate a treaty and treated them like foreign dignitaries _ _

_ _ washington sent major general arthur st clair from fort washington on an expedition to restore peace in the territory in 1791 _ _
_ _ on november 4 st clairs forces were ambushed and soundly defeated by tribal forces with few survivors despite washingtons warning of surprise attacks _ _
_ _ washington was outraged over what he viewed to be excessive native american brutality and execution of captives including women and children _ _
_ _ st clair resigned his commission and washington replaced him with the revolutionary war hero general anthony wayne _ _
_ _ from 1792 to 1793 wayne instructed his troops on native american warfare tactics and instilled discipline which was lacking under st _ _
_ _ clair _ _
_ _ in august 1794 washington sent wayne into tribal territory with authority to drive them out by burning their villages and crops in the maumee valley _ _
_ _ on august 24 the american army under waynes leadership defeated the western confederacy at the battle of fallen timbers and the treaty of greenville in august 1795 opened up twothirds of the ohio country for american settlement _ _
_ _ originally washington had planned to retire after his first term while many americans could not imagine anyone else taking his place _ _
_ _ after nearly four years as president and dealing with the infighting in his own cabinet and with partisan critics washington showed little enthusiasm in running for a second term while martha also wanted him not to run _ _
_ _ james madison urged him not to retire that his absence would only allow the dangerous political rift in his cabinet and the house to worsen _ _
_ _ jefferson also pleaded with him not to retire and agreed to drop his attacks on hamilton or he would also retire if washington did _ _
_ _ hamilton maintained that washingtons absence would be deplored as the greatest evil to the country at this time _ _
_ _ washingtons close nephew george augustine washington his manager at mount vernon was critically ill and had to be replaced further increasing washingtons desire to retire and return to mount vernon _ _
_ _ when the election of 1792 neared washington did not publicly announce his presidential candidacy _ _
_ _ still he silently consented to run to prevent a further politicalpersonal rift in his cabinet _ _
_ _ the electoral college unanimously elected him president on february 13 1793 and john adams as vice president by a vote of 77 to 50 _ _
_ _ washington with nominal fanfare arrived alone at his inauguration in his carriage _ _
_ _ sworn into office by associate justice william cushing on march 4 1793 in the senate chamber of congress hall in philadelphia washington gave a brief address and then immediately retired to his philadelphia presidential house weary of office and in poor health _ _
_ _ on april 22 1793 during the french revolution washington issued his famous neutrality proclamation and was resolved to pursue a conduct friendly and impartial toward the belligerent powers while he warned americans not to intervene in the international conflict _ _
_ _ although washington recognized frances revolutionary government he would eventually ask french minister to america citizen genêt be recalled over the citizen genêt affair _ _
_ _ genêt was a diplomatic troublemaker who was openly hostile toward washingtons neutrality policy _ _
_ _ he procured four american ships as privateers to strike at spanish forces british allies in florida while organizing militias to strike at other british possessions _ _

_ _ however washingtons relationship with his secretary of war henry knox deteriorated _ _

_ _ frigates _ _
_ _ in the final months of his presidency washington was assailed by his political foes and a partisan press who accused him of being ambitious and greedy while he argued that he had taken no salary during the war and had risked his life in battle _ _
_ _ he regarded the press as a disuniting diabolical force of falsehoods sentiments that he expressed in his farewell address _ _
_ _ at the end of his second term washington retired for personal and political reasons dismayed with personal attacks and to ensure that a truly contested presidential election could be held _ _
_ _ he did not feel bound to a twoterm limit but his retirement set a significant precedent _ _
_ _ washington is often credited with setting the principle of a twoterm presidency but it was thomas jefferson who first refused to run for a third term on political grounds _ _
_ _ in 1796 washington declined to run for a third term of office believing his death in office would create an image of a lifetime appointment _ _
_ _ the precedent of a twoterm limit was created by his retirement from office _ _
_ _ in may 1792 in anticipation of his retirement washington instructed james madison to prepare a valedictory address an initial draft of which was entitled the farewell address _ _
_ _ in may 1796 washington sent the manuscript to his secretary of treasury alexander hamilton who did an extensive rewrite while washington provided final edits _ _
_ _ on september 19 1796 david claypooles american daily advertiser published the final version of the address _ _
_ _ washington stressed that national identity was paramount while a united america would safeguard freedom and prosperity _ _
_ _ he warned the nation of three eminent dangers regionalism partisanship and foreign entanglements and said the name of american which belongs to you in your national capacity must always exalt the just pride of patriotism more than any appellation derived from local discriminations _ _
_ _ washington called for men to move beyond partisanship for the common good stressing that the united states must concentrate on its own interests _ _
_ _ he warned against foreign alliances and their influence in domestic affairs and bitter partisanship and the dangers of political parties _ _
_ _ he counseled friendship and commerce with all nations but advised against involvement in european wars _ _
_ _ he stressed the importance of religion asserting that religion and morality are indispensable supports in a republic _ _
_ _ washingtons address favored hamiltons federalist ideology and economic policies _ _
_ _ washington closed the address by reflecting on his legacy _ _
_ _ though in reviewing the incidents of my administration i am unconscious of intentional error i am nevertheless too sensible of my defects not to think it probable that i may have committed many errors _ _
_ _ whatever they may be i fervently beseech the almighty to avert or mitigate the evils to which they may tend _ _
_ _ i shall also carry with me the hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence and that after fortyfive years of my life dedicated to its service with an upright zeal the faults of incompetent abilities will be consigned to oblivion as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest _ _
_ _ after initial publication many republicans including madison criticized the address and believed it was an antifrench campaign document _ _
_ _ madison believed washington was strongly probritish _ _
_ _ madison also was suspicious of who authored the address _ _
_ _ in 1839 washington biographer jared sparks maintained that washingtons  farewell address was printed and published with the laws by order of the legislatures as an evidence of the value they attached to its political precepts and of their affection for its author _ _
_ _ in 1972 washington scholar james flexner referred to the farewell address as receiving as much acclaim as thomas jeffersons declaration of independence and abraham lincolns gettysburg address _ _
_ _ in 2010 historian ron chernow reported the farewell address proved to be one of the most influential statements on republicanism _ _
_ _ washington retired to mount vernon in march 1797 and devoted time to his plantations and other business interests including his distillery _ _
_ _ his plantation operations were only minimally profitable and his lands in the west piedmont were under indian attacks and yielded little income with the squatters there refusing to pay rent _ _
_ _ he attempted to sell these but without success _ _
_ _ he became an even more committed federalist _ _
_ _ he vocally supported the alien and sedition acts and convinced federalist john marshall to run for congress to weaken the jeffersonian hold on virginia _ _
_ _ washington grew restless in retirement prompted by tensions with france and he wrote to secretary of war james mchenry offering to organize president adams army _ _
_ _ in a continuation of the french revolutionary wars french privateers began seizing american ships in 1798 and relations deteriorated with france and led to the quasiwar _ _
_ _ without consulting washington adams nominated him for a lieutenant general commission on july 4 1798 and the position of commanderinchief of the armies _ _
_ _ washington chose to accept replacing james wilkinson and he served as the commanding general from july 13 1798 until his death 17 months later _ _
_ _ he participated in planning for a provisional army but he avoided involvement in details _ _
_ _ in advising mchenry of potential officers for the army he appeared to make a complete break with jeffersons democraticrepublicans you could as soon scrub the blackamoor white as to change the principles of a profest democrat and that he will leave nothing unattempted to overturn the government of this country _ _
_ _ washington delegated the active leadership of the army to hamilton a major general _ _
_ _ no army invaded the united states during this period and washington did not assume a field command _ _
_ _ washington was known to be rich because of the wellknown glorified façade of wealth and grandeur at mount vernon but nearly all his wealth was in the form of land and slaves rather than ready cash _ _
_ _ to supplement his income he erected a distillery for substantial whiskey production _ _
_ _ historians estimate that the estate was worth about 1 million in 1799 dollars equivalent to 15967000 in 2021 _ _

_ _ he returned home late and had guests over for dinner _ _
_ _ he had a sore throat the next day but was well enough to mark trees for cutting _ _
_ _ that evening he complained of chest congestion but was still cheerful _ _
_ _ on saturday he awoke to an inflamed throat and difficulty breathing so he ordered estate overseer george rawlins to remove nearly a pint of his blood bloodletting was a common practice of the time _ _
_ _ his family summoned doctors james craik gustavus richard brown and elisha c _ _
_ _ dick _ _
_ _ dr william thornton arrived some hours after washington died _ _
_ _ dr brown thought washington had quinsy dr dick thought the condition was a more serious violent inflammation of the throat _ _
_ _ they continued the process of bloodletting to approximately five pints and washingtons condition deteriorated further _ _
_ _ dr dick proposed a tracheotomy but the others were not familiar with that procedure and therefore disapproved _ _
_ _ washington instructed brown and dick to leave the room while he assured craik doctor i die hard but i am not afraid to go _ _
_ _ washingtons death came more swiftly than expected _ _
_ _ on his deathbed he instructed his private secretary tobias lear to wait three days before his burial out of fear of being entombed alive _ _

_ _ washington was buried in the old washington family vault at mount vernon situated on a grassy slope overspread with willow juniper cypress and chestnut trees _ _

_ _ in 1832 a joint congressional committee debated moving his body from mount vernon to a crypt in the capitol _ _
_ _ the crypt had been built by architect charles bulfinch in the 1820s during the reconstruction of the burnedout capital after the burning of washington by the british during the war of 1812 _ _
_ _ southern opposition was intense antagonized by an evergrowing rift between north and south many were concerned that washingtons remains could end up on a shore foreign to his native soil if the country became divided and washingtons remains stayed in mount vernon _ _
_ _ on october 7 1837 washingtons remains were placed still in the original lead coffin within a marble sarcophagus designed by william strickland and constructed by john struthers earlier that year _ _

_ _ he believed in a divine power who watched over battlefields was involved in the outcome of war was protecting his life and was involved in american politics—and specifically in the creation of the united states _ _
_ _ modern historian ron chernow has posited that washington avoided evangelistic christianity or hellfireandbrimstone speech along with communion and anything inclined to flaunt his religiosity _ _
_ _ chernow has also said washington never used his religion as a device for partisan purposes or in official undertakings _ _
_ _ no mention of jesus christ appears in his private correspondence and such references are rare in his public writings _ _
_ _ he frequently quoted from the bible or paraphrased it and often referred to the anglican book of common prayer _ _

_ _ within a year he progressed through its ranks to become a master mason _ _

_ _ in washingtons lifetime slavery was deeply ingrained in the economic and social fabric of virginia _ _
_ _ slavery was legal in all of the thirteen colonies prior to the american revolution _ _
_ _ washington owned and rented enslaved african americans and during his lifetime over 577 slaves lived and worked at mount vernon _ _
_ _ he acquired them through inheritance gaining control of 84 dower slaves upon his marriage to martha and purchased at least 71 slaves between 1752 and 1773 _ _
_ _ from 1786 he rented slaves at his death he was renting 41 _ _
_ _ his early views on slavery were no different from any virginia planter of the time _ _
_ _ from the 1760s his attitudes underwent a slow evolution _ _
_ _ the first doubts were prompted by his transition from tobacco to grain crops which left him with a costly surplus of slaves causing him to question the systems economic efficiency _ _
_ _ his growing disillusionment with the institution was spurred by the principles of the american revolution and revolutionary friends such as lafayette and hamilton _ _
_ _ most historians agree the revolution was central to the evolution of washingtons attitudes on slavery after 1783 kenneth morgan writes  began to express inner tensions about the problem of slavery more frequently though always in private _ _
_ _ the many contemporary reports of slave treatment at mount vernon are varied and conflicting _ _
_ _ historian kenneth morgan 2000 maintains that washington was frugal on spending for clothes and bedding for his slaves and only provided them with just enough food and that he maintained strict control over his slaves instructing his overseers to keep them working hard from dawn to dusk yearround _ _
_ _ however historian dorothy twohig 2001 said food clothing and housing seem to have been at least adequate _ _
_ _ washington faced growing debts involved with the costs of supporting slaves _ _
_ _ he held an engrained sense of racial superiority towards african americans but harbored no ill feelings toward them _ _
_ _ some enslaved families worked at different locations on the plantation but were allowed to visit one another on their days off _ _
_ _ washingtons slaves received two hours off for meals during the workday and were given time off on sundays and religious holidays _ _
_ _ some accounts report that washington opposed flogging but at times sanctioned its use generally as a last resort on both men and women slaves _ _
_ _ washington used both reward and punishment to encourage discipline and productivity in his slaves _ _
_ _ he tried appealing to an individuals sense of pride gave better blankets and clothing to the most deserving and motivated his slaves with cash rewards _ _
_ _ he believed watchfulness and admonition to be often better deterrents against transgressions but would punish those who will not do their duty by fair means _ _
_ _ punishment ranged in severity from demotion back to fieldwork through whipping and beatings to permanent separation from friends and family by sale _ _
_ _ historian ron chernow maintains that overseers were required to warn slaves before resorting to the lash and required washingtons written permission before whipping though his extended absences did not always permit this _ _
_ _ washington remained dependent on slave labor to work his farms and negotiated the purchase of more slaves in 1786 and 1787 _ _
_ _ washington brought several of his slaves with him and his family to the federal capital during his presidency _ _
_ _ when the capital moved from new york city to philadelphia in 1791 the president began rotating his slave household staff periodically between the capital and mount vernon _ _
_ _ this was done deliberately to circumvent pennsylvanias slavery abolition act which in part automatically freed any slave who moved to the state and lived there for more than six months _ _
_ _ in may 1796 marthas personal and favorite slave oney judge escaped to portsmouth _ _
_ _ at marthas behest washington attempted to capture ona using a treasury agent but this effort failed _ _
_ _ in february 1797 washingtons personal slave hercules escaped to philadelphia and was never found _ _
_ _ in february 1786 washington took a census of mount vernon and recorded 224 slaves _ _
_ _ by 1799 slaves at mount vernon totaled 317 including 143 children _ _
_ _ washington owned 124 slaves leased 40 and held 153 for his wifes dower interest _ _
_ _ washington supported many slaves who were too young or too old to work greatly increasing mount vernons slave population and causing the plantation to operate at a loss _ _
_ _ based on his letters diary documents accounts from colleagues employees friends and visitors washington slowly developed a cautious sympathy toward abolitionism that eventually ended with his will freeing his militarywar valet billy lee and then subsequently freeing the rest of his personallyowned slaves outright upon marthas death _ _
_ _ as president he remained publicly silent on the topic of slavery believing it was a nationally divisive issue which could destroy the union _ _
_ _ during the american revolutionary war washington began to change his views on slavery _ _
_ _ in a 1778 letter to lund washington he made clear his desire to get quit of negroes when discussing the exchange of slaves for the land he wanted to buy _ _
_ _ the next year washington stated his intention not to separate enslaved families as a result of a change of masters _ _
_ _ during the 1780s washington privately expressed his support for the gradual emancipation of slaves _ _
_ _ between 1783 and 1786 he gave moral support to a plan proposed by lafayette to purchase land and free slaves to work on it but declined to participate in the experiment _ _
_ _ washington privately expressed support for emancipation to prominent methodists thomas coke and francis asbury in 1785 but declined to sign their petition _ _
_ _ in personal correspondence the next year he made clear his desire to see the institution of slavery ended by a gradual legislative process a view that correlated with the mainstream antislavery literature published in the 1780s that washington possessed _ _
_ _ he significantly reduced his purchases of slaves after the war but continued to acquire them in small numbers _ _
_ _ in 1788 washington declined a suggestion from a leading french abolitionist jacques brissot to establish an abolitionist society in virginia stating that although he supported the idea the time was not yet right to confront the issue _ _
_ _ the historian henry wiencek 2003 believes based on a remark that appears in the notebook of his biographer david humphreys that washington considered making a public statement by freeing his slaves on the eve of his presidency in 1789 _ _
_ _ the historian philip d morgan 2005 disagrees believing the remark was a private expression of remorse at his inability to free his slaves _ _
_ _ other historians agree with morgan that washington was determined not to risk national unity over an issue as divisive as slavery _ _
_ _ washington never responded to any of the antislavery petitions he received and the subject was not mentioned in either his last address to congress or his farewell address _ _
_ _ the first clear indication that washington seriously intended to free his slaves appears in a letter written to his secretary tobias lear in 1794 _ _
_ _ washington instructed lear to find buyers for his land in western virginia explaining in a private coda that he was doing so to liberate a certain species of property which i possess very repugnantly to my own feelings _ _
_ _ the plan along with others washington considered in 1795 and 1796 could not be realized because he failed to find buyers for his land his reluctance to break up slave families and the refusal of the custis heirs to help prevent such separations by freeing their dower slaves at the same time _ _
_ _ on july 9 1799 washington finished making his last will the longest provision concerned slavery _ _
_ _ all his slaves were to be freed after the death of his wife martha _ _
_ _ washington said he did not free them immediately because his slaves intermarried with his wifes dower slaves _ _
_ _ he forbade their sale or transportation out of virginia _ _
_ _ his will provided that old and young freed people be taken care of indefinitely younger ones were to be taught to read and write and placed in suitable occupations _ _
_ _ washington freed more than 160 slaves including about 25 he had acquired from his wifes brother bartholomew dandridge in payment of a debt _ _
_ _ he was among the few large slaveholding virginians during the revolutionary era who emancipated their slaves _ _
_ _ on january 1 1801 one year after george washingtons death martha washington signed an order to free his slaves _ _
_ _ many of them having never strayed far from mount vernon were naturally reluctant to try their luck elsewhere others refused to abandon spouses or children still held as dower slaves the custis estate and also stayed with or near martha _ _
_ _ following george washingtons instructions in his will funds were used to feed and clothe the young aged and infirm slaves until the early 1830s _ _
_ _ washingtons legacy endures as one of the most influential in american history since he served as commanderinchief of the continental army a hero of the revolution and the first president of the united states _ _
_ _ various historians maintain that he also was a dominant factor in americas founding the revolutionary war and the constitutional convention _ _
_ _ revolutionary war comrade lighthorse harry lee eulogized him as first in war—first in peace—and first in the hearts of his countrymen _ _
_ _ lees words became the hallmark by which washingtons reputation was impressed upon the american memory with some biographers regarding him as the great exemplar of republicanism _ _
_ _ he set many precedents for the national government and the presidency in particular and he was called the father of his country as early as 1778 _ _
_ _ in 1879 congress proclaimed washingtons birthday to be a federal holiday _ _
_ _ twentiethcentury biographer douglas southall freeman concluded the great big thing stamped across that man is character _ _
_ _ modern historian david hackett fischer has expanded upon freemans assessment defining washingtons character as integrity selfdiscipline courage absolute honesty resolve and decision but also forbearance decency and respect for others _ _
_ _ washington became an international symbol for liberation and nationalism as the leader of the first successful revolution against a colonial empire _ _
_ _ the federalists made him the symbol of their party but the jeffersonians continued to distrust his influence for many years and delayed building the washington monument _ _
_ _ washington was elected a member of the american academy of arts and sciences on january 31 1781 before he had even begun his presidency _ _
_ _ he was posthumously appointed to the grade of general of the armies of the united states during the united states bicentennial to ensure he would never be outranked this was accomplished by the congressional joint resolution public law 94479 passed on january 19 1976 with an effective appointment date of july 4 1976 _ _
_ _ on march 13 1978 washington was militarily promoted to the rank of general of the armies _ _
_ _ parson weems wrote a hagiographic biography in 1809 to honor washington _ _
_ _ historian ron chernow maintains that weems attempted to humanize washington making him look less stern and to inspire patriotism and morality and to foster enduring myths such as washingtons refusal to lie about damaging his fathers cherry tree _ _
_ _ weems accounts have never been proven or disproven _ _
_ _ historian john ferling however maintains that washington remains the only founder and president ever to be referred to as godlike and points out that his character has been the most scrutinized by historians past and present _ _
_ _ historian gordon s wood concludes that the greatest act of his life the one that gave him his greatest fame was his resignation as commanderinchief of the american forces _ _
_ _ chernow suggests that washington was burdened by public life and divided by unacknowledged ambition mingled with selfdoubt _ _
_ _ a 1993 review of presidential polls and surveys consistently ranked washington number 4 3 or 2 among presidents _ _
_ _ a 2018 siena college research institute survey ranked him number 1 among presidents _ _
_ _ in the 21st century washingtons reputation has been critically scrutinized _ _
