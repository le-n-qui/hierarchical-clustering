_ _ congress gave the federal trade commission ftc broad regulatory powers and provided mortgage relief to millions of farmers and homeowners _ _

_ _ in many instances crops were plowed under and livestock killed while many americans died of hunger and were illclothed critics labeled such policies utterly idiotic _ _
_ _ on the positive side nothing did more to rescue the farm family from isolation than the rural electrification administration rea which brought electricity for the first time to millions of rural homes and with it such conveniences as radios and washing machines _ _
_ _ reform of the economy was the goal of the national industrial recovery act nira of 1933 _ _

_ _ this included a reduction in military spending from 752  million in 1932 to 531  million in 1934 and a 40 cut in spending on veterans benefits _ _
_ _ 500000 veterans and widows were removed from the pension rolls and benefits were reduced for the remainder _ _
_ _ federal salaries were cut and spending on research and education was reduced _ _
_ _ the veterans were well organized and strongly protested so most benefits were restored or increased by 1934 _ _
_ _ veterans groups such as the american legion and the veterans of foreign wars won their campaign to transform their benefits from payments due in 1945 to immediate cash when congress overrode the presidents veto and passed the bonus act in january 1936 _ _
_ _ it pumped sums equal to 2 of the gdp into the consumer economy and had a major stimulus effect _ _
_ _ roosevelt expected that his party would lose seats in the 1934 congressional elections as the presidents party had done in most previous midterm elections _ _
_ _ unexpectedly the democrats picked up seats in both houses of congress _ _
_ _ empowered by the publics vote of confidence the first item on roosevelts agenda in the 74th congress was the creation of a social insurance program _ _
_ _ the social security act established social security and promised economic security for the elderly the poor and the sick _ _
_ _ roosevelt insisted that it should be funded by payroll taxes rather than from the general fund saying we put those payroll contributions there so as to give the contributors a legal moral and political right to collect their pensions and unemployment benefits _ _
_ _ with those taxes in there no damn politician can ever scrap my social security program _ _
_ _ compared with the social security systems in western european countries the social security act of 1935 was rather conservative _ _
_ _ but for the first time the federal government took responsibility for the economic security of the aged the temporarily unemployed dependent children and disabled people _ _
_ _ against roosevelts original intention for universal coverage the act excluded farmers domestic workers and other groups which made up about forty percent of the labor force _ _
_ _ roosevelt consolidated the various relief organizations though some like the pwa continued to exist _ _

_ _ the act also established the national labor relations board nlrb to facilitate wage agreements and suppress repeated labor disturbances _ _

_ _ the result was a tremendous growth of membership in the labor unions especially in the massproduction sector _ _
_ _ when the flint sitdown strike threatened the production of general motors roosevelt broke with the precedent set by many former presidents and refused to intervene the strike ultimately led to the unionization of both general motors and its rivals in the american automobile industry _ _
_ _ while the first new deal of 1933 had broad support from most sectors the second new deal challenged the business community _ _
_ _ conservative democrats led by al smith fought back with the american liberty league savagely attacking roosevelt and equating him with socialism _ _
_ _ but smith overplayed his hand and his boisterous rhetoric let roosevelt isolate his opponents and identify them with the wealthy vested interests that opposed the new deal strengthening roosevelt for the 1936 landslide _ _
_ _ by contrast labor unions energized by labor legislation signed up millions of new members and became a major backer of roosevelts reelections in 1936 1940 and 1944 _ _
_ _ burns suggests that roosevelts policy decisions were guided more by pragmatism than ideology and that he was like the general of a guerrilla army whose columns fighting blindly in the mountains through dense ravines and thickets suddenly converge half by plan and half by coincidence and debouch into the plain below _ _
_ _ roosevelt argued that such apparently haphazard methodology was necessary _ _
_ _ the country needs and unless i mistake its temper the country demands bold persistent experimentation he wrote _ _
_ _ it is common sense to take a method and try it if it fails admit it frankly and try another _ _
_ _ but above all try something _ _
_ _ eight million workers remained unemployed in 1936 and though economic conditions had improved since 1932 they remained sluggish _ _
_ _ by 1936 roosevelt had lost the backing he once held in the business community because of his support for the nlrb and the social security act _ _
_ _ the republicans had few alternative candidates and nominated kansas governor alf landon a littleknown bland candidate whose chances were damaged by the public reemergence of the stillunpopular herbert hoover _ _
_ _ while roosevelt campaigned on his new deal programs and continued to attack hoover landon sought to win voters who approved of the goals of the new deal but disagreed with its implementation _ _
_ _ an attempt by louisiana senator huey long to organize a leftwing third party collapsed after longs assassination in 1935 _ _
_ _ the remnants helped by father charles coughlin supported william lemke of the newly formed union party _ _
_ _ roosevelt won renomination with little opposition at the 1936 democratic national convention while his allies overcame southern resistance to permanently abolish the longestablished rule that had required democratic presidential candidates to win the votes of twothirds of the delegates rather than a simple majority _ _
_ _ in the election against landon and a thirdparty candidate roosevelt won 608 of the vote and carried every state except maine and vermont _ _
_ _ the democratic ticket won the highest proportion of the popular vote _ _
_ _ democrats also expanded their majorities in congress winning control of over threequarters of the seats in each house _ _
_ _ the election also saw the consolidation of the new deal coalition while the democrats lost some of their traditional allies in big business they were replaced by groups such as organized labor and african americans the latter of whom voted democratic for the first time since the civil war _ _
_ _ roosevelt lost highincome voters especially businessmen and professionals but made major gains among the poor and minorities _ _
_ _ he won 86 percent of the jewish vote 81 percent of catholics 80 percent of union members 76 percent of southerners 76 percent of blacks in northern cities and 75 percent of people on relief _ _
_ _ roosevelt carried 102 of the countrys 106 cities with a population of 100000 or more _ _
_ _ the supreme court became roosevelts primary domestic focus during his second term after the court overturned many of his programs including nira _ _
_ _ the more conservative members of the court upheld the principles of the lochner era which saw numerous economic regulations struck down on the basis of freedom of contract _ _
_ _ roosevelt proposed the judicial procedures reform bill of 1937 which would have allowed him to appoint an additional justice for each incumbent justice over the age of 70 in 1937 there were six supreme court justices over the age of 70 _ _
_ _ the size of the court had been set at nine since the passage of the judiciary act of 1869 and congress had altered the number of justices six other times throughout us _ _
_ _ history _ _
_ _ roosevelts court packing plan ran into intense political opposition from his own party led by vice president garner since it upset the separation of powers _ _
_ _ a bipartisan coalition of liberals and conservatives of both parties opposed the bill and chief justice charles evans hughes broke with precedent by publicly advocating the defeat of the bill _ _
_ _ any chance of passing the bill ended with the death of senate majority leader joseph taylor robinson in july 1937 _ _
_ _ starting with the 1937 case of west coast hotel co v parrish the court began to take a more favorable view of economic regulations _ _
_ _ historians have described this as the switch in time that saved nine _ _
_ _ that same year roosevelt appointed a supreme court justice for the first time and by 1941 seven of the nine justices had been appointed by roosevelt _ _
_ _ after parish the court shifted its focus from judicial review of economic regulations to the protection of civil liberties _ _
_ _ four of roosevelts supreme court appointees felix frankfurter robert h jackson
hugo black and william o douglas were particularly influential in reshaping the jurisprudence of the court _ _
_ _ with roosevelts influence on the wane following the failure of the judicial procedures reform bill of 1937 conservative democrats joined with republicans to block the implementation of further new deal programs _ _
_ _ roosevelt did manage to pass some legislation including the housing act of 1937 a second agricultural adjustment act and the fair labor standards act flsa of 1938 which was the last major piece of new deal legislation _ _
_ _ the flsa outlawed child labor established a federal minimum wage and required overtime pay for certain employees who work in excess of fortyhours per week _ _
_ _ he also won passage of the reorganization act of 1939 and subsequently created the executive office of the president making it the nerve center of the federal administrative system _ _
_ _ when the economy began to deteriorate again in mid1937 during the onset of the recession of 1937–1938 roosevelt launched a rhetorical campaign against big business and monopoly power in the united states alleging that the recession was the result of a capital strike and even ordering the federal bureau of investigation to look for a criminal conspiracy of which they found none _ _
_ _ he then asked congress for 5 billion equivalent to 9425 billion in 2021 in relief and public works funding _ _
_ _ this managed to eventually create as many as 33 million wpa jobs by 1938 _ _
_ _ projects accomplished under the wpa ranged from new federal courthouses and post offices to facilities and infrastructure for national parks bridges and other infrastructure across the country and architectural surveys and archaeological excavations—investments to construct facilities and preserve important resources _ _
_ _ beyond this however roosevelt recommended to a special congressional session only a permanent national farm act administrative reorganization and regional planning measures all of which were leftovers from a regular session _ _
_ _ according to burns this attempt illustrated roosevelts inability to settle on a basic economic program _ _
_ _ determined to overcome the opposition of conservative democrats in congress roosevelt became involved in the 1938 democratic primaries actively campaigning for challengers who were more supportive of new deal reform _ _
_ _ roosevelt failed badly managing to defeat only one of the ten targeted a conservative democrat from new york city _ _
_ _ in the november 1938 elections democrats lost six senate seats and 71 house seats with losses concentrated among pronew deal democrats _ _
_ _ when congress reconvened in 1939 republicans under senator robert taft formed a conservative coalition with southern democrats virtually ending roosevelts ability to enact his domestic proposals _ _
_ _ despite their opposition to roosevelts domestic policies many of these conservative congressmen would provide crucial support for roosevelts foreign policy before and during world war ii _ _
_ _ roosevelt had a lifelong interest in the environment and conservation starting with his youthful interest in forestry on his family estate _ _
_ _ although he was never an outdoorsman or sportsman on theodore roosevelts scale his growth of the national systems was comparable _ _
_ _ when franklin was governor of new york the temporary emergency relief administration was essentially a statelevel predecessor of the federal civilian conservation corps with 10000 or more men building fire trails combating soil erosion and planting tree seedlings in marginal farmland in the state of new york _ _
_ _ as president roosevelt was active in expanding funding and promoting the national park and national forest systems _ _
_ _ their popularity soared from three million visitors a year at the start of the decade to 155 million in 1939 _ _
_ _ the civilian conservation corps enrolled 34 million young men and built 13000 miles 21000 kilometres of trails planted two billion trees and upgraded 125000 miles 201000 kilometres of dirt roads _ _
_ _ every state had its own state parks and roosevelt made sure that wpa and ccc projects were set up to upgrade them as well as the national systems _ _
_ _ government spending increased from 80 of the gross national product gnp under hoover in 1932 to 102 in 1936 _ _
_ _ the national debt as a percentage of the gnp had more than doubled under hoover from 16 to 40 of the gnp in early 1933 _ _
_ _ it held steady at close to 40 as late as fall 1941 then grew rapidly during the war _ _
_ _ the gnp was 34 higher in 1936 than in 1932 and 58 higher in 1940 on the eve of war _ _

_ _ total employment during roosevelts term expanded by 1831 million jobs with an average annual increase in jobs during his administration of 53 _ _
_ _ the main foreign policy initiative of roosevelts first term was the good neighbor policy which was a reevaluation of us policy toward latin america _ _
_ _ the united states frequently intervened in latin america following the promulgation of the monroe doctrine in 1823 and the united states occupied several latin american nations in the banana wars that occurred following the spanish–american war of 1898 _ _
_ _ after roosevelt took office he withdrew us forces from haiti and reached new treaties with cuba and panama ending their status as us protectorates _ _
_ _ in december 1933 roosevelt signed the montevideo convention on the rights and duties of states renouncing the right to intervene unilaterally in the affairs of latin american countries _ _
_ _ roosevelt also normalized relations with the soviet union which the united states had refused to recognize since the 1920s _ _
_ _ he hoped to renegotiate the russian debt from world war i and open trade relations but no progress was made on either issue and both nations were soon disillusioned by the accord _ _
_ _ the rejection of the treaty of versailles in 1919–1920 marked the dominance of isolationism in american foreign policy _ _
_ _ despite roosevelts wilsonian background he and secretary of state cordell hull acted with great care not to provoke isolationist sentiment _ _
_ _ the isolationist movement was bolstered in the early to mid1930s by senator gerald nye and others who succeeded in their effort to stop the merchants of death in the us from selling arms abroad _ _
_ _ this effort took the form of the neutrality acts the president was refused a provision he requested giving him the discretion to allow the sale of arms to victims of aggression _ _
_ _ he largely acquiesced to congresss noninterventionist policies in the earlytomid 1930s _ _
_ _ in the interim fascist italy under benito mussolini proceeded to overcome ethiopia and the italians joined nazi germany under adolf hitler in supporting general francisco franco and the nationalist cause in the spanish civil war _ _
_ _ as that conflict drew to a close in early 1939 roosevelt expressed regret in not aiding the spanish republicans _ _
_ _ when japan invaded china in 1937 isolationism limited roosevelts ability to aid china despite atrocities like the nanking massacre and the uss panay incident _ _
_ _ germany annexed austria in 1938 and soon turned its attention to its eastern neighbors _ _
_ _ roosevelt made it clear that in the event of german aggression against czechoslovakia the us would remain neutral _ _
_ _ after completion of the munich agreement and the execution of kristallnacht american public opinion turned against germany and roosevelt began preparing for a possible war with germany _ _
_ _ relying on an interventionist political coalition of southern democrats and businessoriented republicans roosevelt oversaw the expansion of us airpower and war production capacity _ _
_ _ when world war ii began in september 1939 with germanys invasion of poland and britain and frances subsequent declaration of war upon germany roosevelt sought ways to assist britain and france militarily _ _
_ _ isolationist leaders like charles lindbergh and senator william borah successfully mobilized opposition to roosevelts proposed repeal of the neutrality act but roosevelt won congressional approval of the sale of arms on a cashandcarry basis _ _
_ _ he also began a regular secret correspondence with britains first lord of the admiralty winston churchill in september 1939—the first of 1700 letters and telegrams between them _ _
_ _ roosevelt forged a close personal relationship with churchill who became prime minister of the united kingdom in may 1940 _ _
_ _ the fall of france in june 1940 shocked the american public and isolationist sentiment declined _ _
_ _ in july 1940 roosevelt appointed two interventionist republican leaders henry l stimson and frank knox as secretaries of war and the navy respectively _ _
_ _ both parties gave support to his plans for a rapid buildup of the american military but the isolationists warned that roosevelt would get the nation into an unnecessary war with germany _ _

_ _ in the months prior to the july 1940 democratic national convention there was much speculation as to whether roosevelt would run for an unprecedented third term _ _
_ _ the president was silent and even his closest advisors were in the dark _ _
_ _ the twoterm tradition although not yet enshrined in the constitution had been established by george washington when he refused to run for a third term in the 1796 presidential election _ _
_ _ roosevelt refused to give a definitive statement as to his willingness to be a candidate again and he even indicated to some ambitious democrats such as james farley that he would not run for a third term and that they could seek the democratic nomination _ _
_ _ farley and vice president john garner were not pleased with roosevelts decision to break from washingtons precedent _ _
_ _ as germany swept through western europe and menaced britain in mid1940 roosevelt decided that only he had the necessary experience and skills to see the nation safely through the nazi threat _ _
_ _ he was aided by the partys political bosses who feared that no democrat except roosevelt could defeat wendell willkie the popular republican nominee _ _
_ _ at the july 1940 democratic convention in chicago roosevelt easily swept aside challenges from farley and vice president garner who had turned against roosevelt in his second term because of his liberal economic and social policies _ _
_ _ to replace garner on the ticket roosevelt turned to secretary of agriculture henry wallace of iowa a former republican who strongly supported the new deal and was popular in farm states _ _
_ _ the choice was strenuously opposed by many of the partys conservatives who felt wallace was too radical and eccentric in his private life to be an effective running mate _ _
_ _ but roosevelt insisted that without wallace on the ticket he would decline renomination and wallace won the vicepresidential nomination defeating speaker of the house william b bankhead and other candidates _ _
_ _ a late august poll taken by gallup found the race to be essentially tied but roosevelts popularity surged in september following the announcement of the destroyers for bases agreement _ _
_ _ willkie supported much of the new deal as well as rearmament and aid to britain but warned that roosevelt would drag the country into another european war _ _
_ _ responding to willkies attacks roosevelt promised to keep the country out of the war _ _
_ _ over its last month the campaign degenerated into a series of outrageous accusations and mudslinging if not by the two candidates themselves then by their respective parties _ _
_ _ roosevelt won the 1940 election with 55 of the popular vote 38 of the 48 states and almost 85 of the electoral vote _ _

_ _ roosevelt maintained close personal control of all major diplomatic and military decisions working closely with his generals and admirals the war and navy departments the british and even the soviet union _ _
_ _ his key advisors on diplomacy were harry hopkins who was based in the white house sumner welles based in the state department and henry morgenthau jr at treasury _ _
_ _ in military affairs roosevelt worked most closely with secretary henry l stimson at the war department army chief of staff george marshall and admiral william d _ _
_ _ leahy _ _
_ _ by late 1940 rearmament was in high gear partly to expand and reequip the army and navy and partly to become the arsenal of democracy for britain and other countries _ _
_ _ with his four freedoms speech in january 1941 roosevelt laid out the case for an allied battle for basic rights throughout the world _ _
_ _ assisted by willkie roosevelt won congressional approval of the lendlease program which directed massive military and economic aid to britain and china _ _
_ _ in sharp contrast to the loans of world war i there would be no repayment after the war _ _
_ _ as roosevelt took a firmer stance against japan germany and italy american isolationists such as charles lindbergh and the america first committee vehemently attacked roosevelt as an irresponsible warmonger _ _
_ _ when germany invaded the soviet union in june 1941 roosevelt agreed to extend lendlease to the soviets _ _
_ _ thus roosevelt had committed the us to the allied side with a policy of all aid short of war _ _
_ _ by july 1941 roosevelt authorized the creation of the office of the coordinator of interamerican affairs ociaa to counter perceived propaganda efforts in latin america by germany and italy _ _
_ _ in august 1941 roosevelt and churchill conducted a highly secret bilateral meeting in which they drafted the atlantic charter conceptually outlining global wartime and postwar goals _ _
_ _ this would be the first of several wartime conferences churchill and roosevelt would meet ten more times in person _ _
_ _ though churchill pressed for an american declaration of war against germany roosevelt believed that congress would reject any attempt to bring the united states into the war _ _
_ _ in september a german submarine fired on the us destroyer greer and roosevelt declared that the us navy would assume an escort role for allied convoys in the atlantic as far east as great britain and would fire upon german ships or submarines uboats of the kriegsmarine if they entered the us navy zone _ _
_ _ according to historian george donelson moss roosevelt misled americans by reporting the greer incident as if it would have been an unprovoked german attack on a peaceful american ship _ _
_ _ this shoot on sight policy effectively declared naval war on germany and was favored by americans by a margin of 2to1 _ _
_ _ after the german invasion of poland the primary concern of both roosevelt and his top military staff was on the war in europe but japan also presented foreign policy challenges _ _
_ _ relations with japan had continually deteriorated since its invasion of manchuria in 1931 and they had further worsened with roosevelts support of china _ _
_ _ with the war in europe occupying the attention of the major colonial powers japanese leaders eyed vulnerable colonies such as the dutch east indies french indochina and british malaya _ _

_ _ in a nearly unanimous vote congress declared war on japan _ _
_ _ after the japanese attack at pearl harbor antiwar sentiment in the united states largely evaporated overnight _ _
_ _ on december 11 1941 hitler and mussolini declared war on the united states which responded in kind _ _
_ _ a majority of scholars have rejected the conspiracy theories that roosevelt or any other high government officials knew in advance about the japanese attack on pearl harbor _ _
_ _ the japanese had kept their secrets closely guarded _ _

_ _ roosevelt avoided micromanaging the war and let his top military officers make most decisions _ _
_ _ roosevelts civilian appointees handled the draft and procurement of men and equipment but no civilians – not even the secretaries of war or navy – had a voice in strategy _ _
_ _ roosevelt avoided the state department and conducted highlevel diplomacy through his aides especially harry hopkins whose influence was bolstered by his control of the lend lease funds _ _
_ _ in august 1939 leo szilard and albert einstein sent the einstein–szilárd letter to roosevelt warning of the possibility of a german project to develop nuclear weapons _ _
_ _ szilard realized that the recently discovered process of nuclear fission could be used to create a nuclear chain reaction that could be used as a weapon of mass destruction _ _
_ _ roosevelt feared the consequences of allowing germany to have sole possession of the technology and authorized preliminary research into nuclear weapons _ _
_ _ after the attack on pearl harbor the roosevelt administration secured the funds needed to continue research and selected general leslie groves to oversee the manhattan project which was charged with developing the first nuclear weapons _ _

_ _ roosevelt expected it would be controlled by washington moscow london and beijing and would resolve all major world problems _ _
_ _ roosevelt churchill and stalin met for a second time at the february 1945 yalta conference in crimea _ _

_ _ against soviet pressure roosevelt and churchill refused to consent to impose huge reparations and deindustrialization on germany after the war _ _
_ _ roosevelts role in the yalta conference has been controversial critics charge that he naively trusted the soviet union to allow free elections in eastern europe while supporters argue that there was little more that roosevelt could have done for the eastern european countries given the soviet occupation and the need for cooperation with the soviet union during and after the war _ _
_ _ the allies invaded french north africa in november 1942 securing the surrender of vichy french forces within days of landing _ _

_ _ the japanese advance reached its maximum extent by june 1942 when the us navy scored a decisive victory at the battle of midway _ _
_ _ american and australian forces then began a slow and costly strategy called island hopping or leapfrogging through the pacific islands with the objective of gaining bases from which strategic airpower could be brought to bear on japan and from which japan could ultimately be invaded _ _
_ _ in contrast to hitler roosevelt took no direct part in the tactical naval operations though he approved strategic decisions _ _

_ _ the revenue act of 1942 instituted top tax rates as high as 94 after accounting for the excess profits tax greatly increased the tax base and instituted the first federal withholding tax _ _
_ _ in 1944 roosevelt requested that congress enact legislation which would tax all unreasonable profits both corporate and individual and thereby support his declared need for over 10 billion in revenue for the war and other government measures _ _
_ _ congress overrode roosevelts veto to pass a smaller revenue bill raising 2 billion _ _
_ _ in 1942 with the united states now in the conflict war production increased dramatically but fell short of the goals established by the president due in part to manpower shortages _ _
_ _ the effort was also hindered by numerous strikes especially among union workers in the coal mining and railroad industries which lasted well into 1944 _ _
_ _ nonetheless between 1941 and 1945 the united states produced 24 million trucks 300000 military aircraft 88400 tanks and 40 billion rounds of ammunition _ _
_ _ the production capacity of the united states dwarfed that of other countries for example in 1944 the united states produced more military aircraft than the combined production of germany japan britain and the soviet union _ _
_ _ the white house became the ultimate site for labor mediation conciliation or arbitration _ _
_ _ one particular battle royale occurred between vice president wallace who headed the board of economic warfare and jesse h jones in charge of the reconstruction finance corporation both agencies assumed responsibility for the acquisition of rubber supplies and came to loggerheads over funding _ _
_ _ roosevelt resolved the dispute by dissolving both agencies _ _

_ _ hospital physicians and two outside specialists ordered roosevelt to rest _ _
_ _ his personal physician admiral ross mcintire created a daily schedule that banned business guests for lunch and incorporated two hours of rest each day _ _
_ _ during the 1944 reelection campaign mcintire denied several times that roosevelts health was poor on october 12 for example he announced that the presidents health is perfectly ok _ _
_ _ there are absolutely no organic difficulties at all _ _
_ _ roosevelt realized that his declining health could eventually make it impossible for him to continue as president and in 1945 he told a confidant that he might resign from the presidency following the end of the war _ _
_ _ while some democrats had opposed roosevelts nomination in 1940 the president faced little difficulty in securing his renomination at the 1944 democratic national convention _ _

_ _ party leaders prevailed upon roosevelt to drop vice president wallace from the ticket believing him to be an electoral liability and a poor potential successor in case of roosevelts death _ _
_ _ roosevelt preferred byrnes as wallaces replacement but was convinced to support senator harry s truman of missouri who had earned renown for his investigation of war production inefficiency and was acceptable to the various factions of the party _ _
_ _ on the second vice presidential ballot of the convention truman defeated wallace to win the nomination _ _
_ _ the republicans nominated thomas e dewey the governor of new york who had a reputation as a liberal in his party _ _
_ _ they accused the roosevelt administration of domestic corruption and bureaucratic inefficiency but deweys most effective gambit was to raise discreetly the age issue _ _
_ _ he assailed the president as a tired old man with tired old men in his cabinet pointedly suggesting that the presidents lack of vigor had produced a less than vigorous economic recovery _ _
_ _ roosevelt as most observers could see from his weight loss and haggard appearance was a tired man in 1944 _ _
_ _ but upon entering the campaign in earnest in late september 1944 roosevelt displayed enough passion and fight to allay most concerns and to deflect republican attacks _ _
_ _ with the war still raging he urged voters not to change horses in midstream _ _
_ _ labor unions which had grown rapidly in the war fully supported roosevelt _ _
_ _ roosevelt and truman won the 1944 election by a comfortable margin defeating dewey and his running mate john w bricker with 534 of the popular vote and 432 out of the 531 electoral votes _ _

_ _ roosevelt won strong support from chinese americans and filipino americans but not japanese americans as he presided over their internment during world war ii _ _
_ _ african americans and native americans fared well in two new deal relief programs the civilian conservation corps and the indian reorganization act respectively _ _

_ _ the mexican repatriation policies that began under hoover as a result of the great depression continued with roosevelt as president _ _
_ _ during the 1930s between 355000 and one million mexicans and mexican americans were repatriated or deported to mexico an estimated forty to sixty percent of whom were birthright citizens – overwhelmingly children _ _
_ _ while supported by the federal government actual deportations and repatriations were mostly organized and encouraged by city and state governments often with support from local private entities _ _
_ _ voluntary repatriation was far more common than formal deportation _ _
_ _ the rate of repatriations fell for all immigrants especially for mexicans after roosevelt became president who also instituted more lenient policies towards immigrants especially for wellsettled ones _ _
_ _ the rate of repatriation to mexico fell dramatically by 50 _ _
_ _ the vast majority of formal deportations during the 1930s occurred during hoovers presidency _ _
_ _ roosevelt stopped short of joining naacp leaders in pushing for federal antilynching legislation as he believed that such legislation was unlikely to pass and that his support for it would alienate southern congressmen _ _
_ _ he did however appoint a black cabinet of african american advisers to advise on race relations and african american issues and he publicly denounced lynching as murder _ _
_ _ first lady eleanor roosevelt vocally supported efforts designed to aid the african american community including the fair labor standards act which helped boost wages for nonwhite workers in the south _ _
_ _ in 1941 roosevelt established the fair employment practices committee fepc to implement executive order 8802 which prohibited racial and religious discrimination in employment among defense contractors _ _
_ _ the fepc was the first national program directed against employment discrimination and it played a major role in opening up new employment opportunities to nonwhite workers _ _
_ _ during world war ii the proportion of african american men employed in manufacturing positions rose significantly _ _
_ _ in response to roosevelts policies african americans increasingly defected from the republican party during the 1930s and 1940s becoming an important democratic voting bloc in several northern states _ _
_ _ the attack on pearl harbor raised concerns in the public regarding the possibility of sabotage by japanese americans _ _
_ _ this suspicion was fed by longstanding racism against japanese immigrants as well as the findings of the roberts commission which concluded that the attack on pearl harbor had been assisted by japanese spies _ _
_ _ on february 19 1942 president roosevelt signed executive order 9066 which relocated 110000 japaneseamerican citizens and immigrants most of whom lived on the pacific coast _ _
_ _ they were forced to liquidate their properties and businesses and interned in hastily built camps in interior harsh locations _ _
_ _ distracted by other issues roosevelt had delegated the decision for internment to secretary of war stimson who in turn relied on the judgment of assistant secretary of war john j mccloy _ _
_ _ the supreme court upheld the constitutionality of the executive order in the 1944 case of korematsu v united states _ _

_ _ in 1923 as a member of the harvard board of directors roosevelt decided there were too many jewish students at harvard university and helped institute a quota to limit the number of jews admitted to harvard _ _
_ _ after kristallnacht in 1938 roosevelt did not loosen immigration quotas and his state department took steps to prevent jews and other refugees from entering the country _ _
_ _ however he was prevented from accepting further jewish immigrants particularly refugees by the restrictive immigration act of 1924 and antisemitism among voters _ _
_ _ dubious  – discuss according to rafael medoff the us president could have saved 190000 jewish lives by telling his state department to fill immigration quotas to the legal limit but his administration discouraged and disqualified jewish refugees based on its prohibitive requirements that left less than 25 of the quotas filled _ _
_ _ hitler chose to implement the final solution—the extermination of the european jewish population—by january 1942 and american officials learned of the scale of the nazi extermination campaign in the following months _ _
_ _ against the objections of the state department roosevelt convinced the other allied leaders to jointly issue the joint declaration by members of the united nations which condemned the ongoing holocaust and warned to try its perpetrators as war criminals _ _
_ _ in 1943 roosevelt told us government officials that there should be limits on jews in various professions to eliminate the specific and understandable complaints which the germans bore towards the jews in germany _ _
_ _ the same year roosevelt was personally briefed by polish home army intelligence agent jan karski who was an eyewitness of the holocaust  pleading for action karski told him that 18 million jews had already been exterminated _ _
_ _ karski recalled that in response roosevelt did not ask one question about the jews _ _
_ _ in january 1944 roosevelt established the war refugee board to aid jews and other victims of axis atrocities _ _
_ _ aside from these actions roosevelt believed that the best way to help the persecuted populations of europe was to end the war as quickly as possible _ _
_ _ top military leaders and war department leaders rejected any campaign to bomb the extermination camps or the rail lines leading to the camps fearing it would be a diversion from the war effort _ _

_ _ historians and political scientists consistently rank roosevelt george washington and abraham lincoln as the three greatest presidents although the order varies _ _
_ _ reflecting on roosevelts presidency which brought the united states through the great depression and world war ii to a prosperous future biographer jean edward smith said in 2007 he lifted himself from a wheelchair to lift the nation from its knees _ _
_ _ his commitment to the working class and unemployed in need of relief in the nations longest recession made him a favorite of the blue collar workers labor unions and ethnic minorities _ _
_ _ the rapid expansion of government programs that occurred during roosevelts term redefined the role of the government in the united states and roosevelts advocacy of government social programs was instrumental in redefining liberalism for coming generations _ _
_ _ roosevelt firmly established the united states leadership role on the world stage with his role in shaping and financing world war ii _ _
_ _ his isolationist critics faded away and even the republicans joined in his overall policies _ _
_ _ he also created a new understanding of the presidency permanently increasing the power of the president at the expense of congress _ _

_ _ some junior new dealers played leading roles in the presidencies of truman john kennedy and lyndon johnson _ _
_ _ kennedy came from a roosevelthating family _ _
_ _ historian william leuchtenburg says that before 1960  kennedy showed a conspicuous lack of inclination to identify himself as a new deal liberal _ _
_ _ he adds as president kennedy never wholly embraced the roosevelt tradition and at times he deliberately severed himself from it _ _
_ _ by contrast young lyndon johnson had been an enthusiastic new dealer and a favorite of roosevelt _ _
_ _ johnson modelled his presidency on roosevelts and relied heavily on new deal lawyer abe fortas as well as james h rowe anna m rosenberg thomas gardiner corcoran and benjamin v _ _
_ _ cohen _ _
_ _ during his presidency and continuing to a lesser extent afterwards there has been much criticism of roosevelt some of it intense _ _
_ _ critics have questioned not only his policies positions and the consolidation of power that occurred due to his responses to the crises of the depression and world war ii but also his breaking with tradition by running for a third term as president _ _
_ _ long after his death new lines of attack criticized roosevelts policies regarding helping the jews of europe incarcerating the japanese on the west coast and opposing antilynching legislation _ _
