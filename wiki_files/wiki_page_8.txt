_ _ johnsons biographer robert caro accepts johnsons account and supports it with testimony from the aircrew concerned the aircraft was attacked disabling one engine and it turned back before reaching its objective though remaining under heavy fire _ _
_ _ others claim that it turned back because of generator trouble before reaching the objective and before encountering enemy aircraft and never came under fire this is supported by official flight records _ _

_ _ his gallant actions enabled him to obtain and return with valuable information _ _
_ _ johnson who had used a movie camera to record conditions reported to roosevelt to navy leaders and congress that conditions were deplorable and unacceptable some historians have suggested this was in exchange for macarthurs recommendation to award the silver star _ _

_ _ he probed the peacetime business as usual inefficiencies that permeated the naval war and demanded that admirals shape up and get the job done _ _
_ _ johnson went too far when he proposed a bill that would crack down on the draft exemptions of shipyard workers if they were absent from work too often organized labor blocked the bill and denounced him _ _
_ _ johnsons biographer robert dallek concludes the mission was a temporary exposure to danger calculated to satisfy johnsons personal and political wishes but it also represented a genuine effort on his part however misplaced to improve the lot of americas fighting men _ _
_ _ in addition to the silver star johnson received the american campaign medal asiaticpacific campaign medal and the world war ii victory medal _ _

_ _ stevenson came in first in the primary but lacked a majority so a runoff election was held johnson campaigned harder while stevensons efforts slumped due to a lack of funds _ _
_ _ us presidential historian michael beschloss observed that johnson gave white supremacist speeches during the 1948 campaign in order to secure the white vote _ _
_ _ this cemented his reputation as a moderate in american politics which would enable his ability to pivot and further civil rights causes upon assuming the presidency _ _
_ _ the runoff vote count handled by the democratic state central committee took a week _ _
_ _ johnson was announced the winner by 87 votes out of 988295 an extremely narrow margin of victory _ _

_ _ johnson soundly defeated republican jack porter in the general election in november and went to washington permanently dubbed landslide lyndon _ _
_ _ johnson dismissive of his critics happily adopted the nickname _ _
_ _ once in the senate johnson was known among his colleagues for his highly successful courtships of older senators especially senator richard russell democrat from georgia the leader of the conservative coalition and arguably the most powerful man in the senate _ _
_ _ johnson proceeded to gain russells favor in the same way he had courted speaker sam rayburn and gained his crucial support in the house _ _
_ _ johnson was appointed to the senate armed services committee and in 1950 helped create the preparedness investigating subcommittee _ _
_ _ he became its chairman and conducted investigations of defense costs and efficiency _ _
_ _ these investigations revealed old investigations and demanded actions that were already being taken in part by the truman administration although it can be said that the committees investigations reinforced the need for changes _ _
_ _ johnson gained headlines and national attention through his handling of the press the efficiency with which his committee issued new reports and the fact that he ensured that every report was endorsed unanimously by the committee _ _
_ _ he used his political influence in the senate to receive broadcast licenses from the federal communications commission in his wifes name _ _
_ _ after the 1950 general elections johnson was chosen as senate majority whip in 1951 under the new majority leader ernest mcfarland of arizona and served from 1951 to 1953 _ _
_ _ in the 1952 general election republicans won a majority in both the house and senate _ _
_ _ among defeated democrats that year was mcfarland who lost to upstart barry goldwater _ _
_ _ in january 1953 johnson was chosen by his fellow democrats to be minority leader he became the most junior senator ever elected to this position _ _
_ _ one of his first actions was to eliminate the seniority system in making appointments to committees while retaining it for chairmanships _ _
_ _ in the 1954 election johnson was reelected to the senate and since the democrats won the majority in the senate then became majority leader _ _
_ _ former majority leader william knowland of california became the minority leader _ _
_ _ johnsons duties were to schedule legislation and help pass measures favored by the democrats _ _

_ _ along with the rest of the nation johnson was appalled by the threat of possible soviet domination of space flight implied by the launch of the first artificial earth satellite sputnik 1 and used his influence to ensure passage of the 1958 national aeronautics and space act which established the civilian space agency nasa _ _
_ _ historians caro and dallek consider lyndon johnson the most effective senate majority leader in history _ _
_ _ he was unusually proficient at gathering information _ _
_ _ one biographer suggests he was the greatest intelligence gatherer washington has ever known discovering exactly where every senator stood on issues his philosophy and prejudices his strengths and weaknesses and what it took to get his vote _ _
_ _ robert baker claimed that johnson would occasionally send senators on nato trips to avoid their dissenting votes _ _
_ _ central to johnsons control was the treatment described by two journalists _ _
_ _ the treatment could last ten minutes or four hours _ _
_ _ it came enveloping its target at the johnson ranch swimming pool in one of johnsons offices in the senate cloakroom on the floor of the senate itself – wherever johnson might find a fellow senator within his reach _ _
_ _ its tone could be supplication accusation cajolery exuberance scorn tears complaint and the hint of threat _ _
_ _ it was all of these together _ _
_ _ it ran the gamut of human emotions _ _
_ _ its velocity was breathtaking and it was all in one direction _ _
_ _ interjections from the target were rare _ _
_ _ johnson anticipated them before they could be spoken _ _
_ _ he moved in close his face a scant millimeter from his target his eyes widening and narrowing his eyebrows rising and falling _ _
_ _ from his pockets poured clippings memos statistics _ _
_ _ mimicry humor and the genius of analogy made the treatment an almost hypnotic experience and rendered the target stunned and helpless _ _
_ _ in 1955 johnson persuaded oregons independent wayne morse to join the democratic caucus _ _
_ _ a 60cigaretteperday smoker johnson suffered a nearfatal heart attack on july 2 1955 at age 46 _ _
_ _ he abruptly gave up smoking as a result and with only a couple of exceptions did not resume the habit until after he left the white house on january 20 1969 _ _
_ _ johnson announced he would remain as his partys leader in the senate on new years eve 1955 his doctors reporting he had made a most satisfactory recovery since his heart attack five months before _ _
_ _ johnsons success in the senate rendered him a potential democratic presidential candidate he had been the favorite son candidate of the texas delegation at the partys national convention in 1956 and appeared to be in a strong position to run for the 1960 nomination _ _
_ _ jim rowe repeatedly urged johnson to launch a campaign in early 1959 but johnson thought it better to wait thinking that john kennedys efforts would create a division in the ranks which could then be exploited _ _
_ _ rowe finally joined the humphrey campaign in frustration another move that johnson thought played into his own strategy _ _
_ _ johnson made a late entry into the campaign in july 1960 which coupled with a reluctance to leave washington allowed the rival kennedy campaign to secure a substantial early advantage among democratic state party officials _ _
_ _ johnson underestimated kennedys endearing qualities of charm and intelligence as compared to his reputation as the more crude and wheelingdealing landslide lyndon _ _
_ _ caro suggests that johnsons hesitancy was the result of an overwhelming fear of failure _ _
_ _ johnson attempted in vain to capitalize on kennedys youth poor health and failure to take a position regarding joseph mccarthy and mccarthyism _ _
_ _ he had formed a stop kennedy coalition with adlai stevenson stuart symington and hubert humphrey but it proved a failure _ _
_ _ despite johnson having the support of established democrats and the party leadership this did not translate into popular approval _ _
_ _ johnson received 409 votes on the only ballot at the democratic convention to kennedys 806 and so the convention nominated kennedy _ _
_ _ tip oneill was a representative from kennedys home state of massachusetts at that time and he recalled that johnson approached him at the convention and said tip i know you have to support kennedy at the start but id like to have you with me on the second ballot _ _
_ _ oneill replied senator theres not going to be any second ballot _ _
_ _ according to kennedys special counsel myer feldman and kennedy himself it is impossible to reconstruct the precise manner in which johnsons vicepresidential nomination ultimately took place _ _
_ _ kennedy did realize that he could not be elected without the support of traditional southern democrats most of whom had backed johnson nevertheless labor leaders were unanimous in their opposition to johnson _ _
_ _ aflcio president george meany called johnson the archfoe of labor while illinois aflcio president reuben soderstrom asserted kennedy had made chumps out of leaders of the american labor movement _ _
_ _ after much back and forth with party leaders and others on the matter kennedy did offer johnson the vicepresidential nomination at the los angeles biltmore hotel at 1015 am on july 14 the morning after he was nominated and johnson accepted _ _
_ _ from that point to the actual nomination that evening the facts are in dispute in many respects _ _
_ _ convention chairman leroy collins declaration of a twothirds majority in favor by voice vote is even disputed _ _
_ _ seymour hersh stated that robert f kennedy known as bobby hated johnson for his attacks on the kennedy family and later maintained that his brother offered the position to johnson merely as a courtesy expecting him to decline _ _
_ _ arthur m schlesinger jr concurred with robert kennedys version of events and put forth that john kennedy would have preferred stuart symington as his runningmate alleging that johnson teamed with house speaker sam rayburn and pressured kennedy to favor johnson _ _
_ _ robert kennedy wanted his brother to choose labor leader walter reuther _ _
_ _ biographer robert caro offered a different perspective he wrote that the kennedy campaign was desperate to win what was forecast to be a very close election against richard nixon and henry cabot lodge jr johnson was needed on the ticket to help carry texas and the southern states _ _
_ _ caros research showed that on july 14 john kennedy started the process while johnson was still asleep _ _
_ _ at 630 am john kennedy asked robert kennedy to prepare an estimate of upcoming electoral votes including texas _ _
_ _ robert called pierre salinger and kenneth odonnell to assist him _ _
_ _ salinger realized the ramifications of counting texas votes as their own and asked him whether he was considering a kennedy–johnson ticket and robert replied yes _ _
_ _ caro contends that it was then that john kennedy called johnson to arrange a meeting he also called pennsylvania governor david l lawrence a johnson backer to request that he nominate johnson for vice president if johnson were to accept the role _ _
_ _ according to caro kennedy and johnson met and johnson said that kennedy would have trouble with kennedy supporters who were antijohnson _ _
_ _ kennedy returned to his suite to announce the kennedy–johnson ticket to his closest supporters including northern political bosses _ _
_ _ odonnell was angry at what he considered a betrayal by kennedy who had previously cast johnson as antilabor and antiliberal _ _
_ _ afterward robert kennedy visited labor leaders who were extremely unhappy with the choice of johnson and after seeing the depth of labor opposition to johnson robert ran messages between the hotel suites of his brother and johnson—apparently trying to undermine the proposed ticket without john kennedys authorization _ _
_ _ caro continues in his analysis that robert kennedy tried to get johnson to agree to be the democratic party chairman rather than the vice president _ _
_ _ johnson refused to accept a change in plans unless it came directly from john kennedy _ _
_ _ despite his brothers interference john kennedy was firm that johnson was who he wanted as running mate he met with staffers such as larry obrien his national campaign manager to say that johnson was to be vice president _ _
_ _ obrien recalled later that john kennedys words were wholly unexpected but that after a brief consideration of the electoral vote situation he thought it was a stroke of genius _ _
_ _ when john and robert kennedy next saw their father joe kennedy he told them that signing johnson as running mate was the smartest thing they had ever done _ _
_ _ another account of how johnsons nomination came about was told by evelyn lincoln jfks secretary both before and during his presidency _ _
_ _ in 1993 in a videotaped interview she described how the decision was made stating she was the only witness to a private meeting between john and robert kennedy in a suite at the biltmore hotel where they made the decision _ _
_ _ she said she went in and out of the room as they spoke and while she was in the room heard them say that johnson had tried to blackmail jfk into offering him the vicepresidential nomination with evidence of his womanizing provided by fbi director j edgar hoover _ _
_ _ she also overheard them discuss possible ways to avoid making the offer and ultimately conclude that jfk had no choice _ _
_ _ at the same time as his vice presidential run johnson also sought a third term in the us senate _ _
_ _ according to robert caro on november 8 1960 lyndon johnson won an election for both the vice presidency of the united states on the kennedy–johnson ticket and for a third term as senator he had texas law changed to allow him to run for both offices _ _
_ _ when he won the vice presidency he made arrangements to resign from the senate as he was required to do under federal law as soon as it convened on january 3 1961 _ _
_ _ in 1988 lloyd bentsen the vice presidential running mate of democratic presidential candidate michael dukakis and a senator from texas took advantage of lyndons law and was able to retain his seat in the senate despite dukakiss loss to george h w bush _ _
_ _ johnson was reelected senator with 1306605 votes 58 percent to republican john towers 927653 411 percent _ _
_ _ fellow democrat william a blakley was appointed to replace johnson as senator but blakley lost a special election in may 1961 to tower _ _
_ _ after the election johnson was quite concerned about the traditionally ineffective nature of his new office and set about to assume authority not allotted to the position _ _
_ _ he initially sought a transfer of the authority of senate majority leader to the vice presidency since that office made him president of the senate but faced vehement opposition from the democratic caucus including members whom he had counted as his supporters _ _
_ _ johnson sought to increase his influence within the executive branch _ _
_ _ he drafted an executive order for kennedys signature granting johnson general supervision over matters of national security and requiring all government agencies to cooperate fully with the vice president in the carrying out of these assignments _ _
_ _ kennedys response was to sign a nonbinding letter requesting johnson to review national security policies instead _ _
_ _ kennedy similarly turned down early requests from johnson to be given an office adjacent to the oval office and to employ a fulltime vice presidential staff within the white house _ _
_ _ his lack of influence was thrown into relief later in 1961 when kennedy appointed johnsons friend sarah t hughes to a federal judgeship whereas johnson had tried and failed to garner the nomination for hughes at the beginning of his vice presidency _ _
_ _ house speaker sam rayburn wrangled the appointment from kennedy in exchange for support of an administration bill _ _
_ _ moreover many members of the kennedy white house were contemptuous of johnson including the presidents brother attorney general robert f kennedy and they ridiculed his comparatively brusque crude manner _ _
_ _ congressman tip oneill recalled that the kennedy men had a disdain for johnson that they didnt even try to hide _ _
_ _ they actually took pride in snubbing him _ _
_ _ kennedy however made efforts to keep johnson busy informed and at the white house often telling aides i cant afford to have my vice president who knows every reporter in washington going around saying were all screwed up so were going to keep him happy _ _
_ _ kennedy appointed him to jobs such as the head of the presidents committee on equal employment opportunities through which he worked with african americans and other minorities _ _
_ _ kennedy may have intended this to remain a more nominal position but taylor branch contends in pillar of fire that johnson pushed the kennedy administrations actions further and faster for civil rights than kennedy originally intended to go _ _
_ _ branch notes the irony of johnson being the advocate for civil rights when the kennedy family had hoped that he would appeal to conservative southern voters _ _
_ _ in particular he notes johnsons memorial day 1963 speech at gettysburg pennsylvania as being a catalyst that led to more action _ _

_ _ johnson took on numerous minor diplomatic missions which gave him some insights into global issues as well as opportunities for selfpromotion in the name of showing the countrys flag _ _
_ _ during his visit to west berlin on august 19–20 1961 johnson calmed berliners who were outraged by the building of the berlin wall _ _
_ _ he also attended cabinet and national security council meetings _ _
_ _ kennedy gave johnson control over all presidential appointments involving texas and appointed him chairman of the presidents ad hoc committee for science _ _
_ _ kennedy also appointed johnson chairman of the national aeronautics and space council _ _
_ _ the soviets beat the united states with the first manned spaceflight in april 1961 and kennedy gave johnson the task of evaluating the state of the us space program and recommending a project that would allow the united states to catch up or beat the soviets _ _
_ _ johnson responded with a recommendation that the united states gain the leadership role by committing the resources to embark on a project to land an american on the moon in the 1960s _ _
_ _ kennedy assigned priority to the space program but johnsons appointment provided potential cover in case of a failure _ _
_ _ johnson was touched by a senate scandal in august 1963 when bobby baker the secretary to the majority leader of the senate and a protégé of johnsons came under investigation by the senate rules committee for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance _ _
_ _ one witness alleged that baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks for the vice president _ _
_ _ baker resigned in october and the investigation did not expand to johnson _ _
_ _ the negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in washington circles that kennedy was planning on dropping johnson from the democratic ticket in the upcoming 1964 presidential election _ _
_ _ however on october 31 1963 a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have johnson on the ticket the following year _ _
_ _ kennedy replied yes to both those questions _ _
_ _ there is little doubt that robert kennedy and johnson hated each other yet john and robert kennedy agreed that dropping johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the south in the 1964 election and they agreed that johnson would stay on the ticket _ _
_ _ johnson assumed the presidency amid a healthy economy with steady growth and low unemployment and with no serious international crises _ _
_ _ therefore he focused his attention on domestic policy until escalation of the vietnam war began in august 1964 _ _
_ _ johnson was quickly sworn in as president on air force one in dallas on november 22 1963 just two hours and eight minutes after john f kennedy was assassinated amid suspicions of a conspiracy against the government _ _
_ _ he was sworn in by us district judge sarah t hughes a family friend _ _
_ _ in the rush johnson took the oath of office using a roman catholic missal from president kennedys desk despite not being catholic due to the missal being mistaken for a bible _ _
_ _ cecil stoughtons iconic photograph of johnson taking the presidential oath of office as mrs kennedy looks on is the most famous photo ever taken aboard a presidential aircraft _ _
_ _ johnson was convinced of the need to make an impression of an immediate transition of power after the assassination to provide stability to a grieving nation in shock _ _
_ _ he and the secret service were concerned that he could also be a target of a conspiracy and felt compelled to rapidly remove the new president from dallas and return him to washington _ _
_ _ this was greeted by some with assertions that johnson was in too much haste to assume power _ _
_ _ on november 27 1963 the new president delivered his let us continue speech to a joint session of congress saying that no memorial oration or eulogy could more eloquently honor president kennedys memory than the earliest possible passage of the civil rights bill for which he fought so long _ _
_ _ the wave of national grief following the assassination gave enormous momentum to johnsons promise to carry out kennedys plans and his policy of seizing kennedys legacy to give momentum to his legislative agenda _ _
_ _ on november 29 1963 just one week after kennedys assassination johnson issued an executive order to rename nasas apollo launch operations center and the nasaair force cape canaveral launch facilities as the john f kennedy space center _ _
_ _ cape canaveral was officially known as cape kennedy from 1963 until 1973 _ _
_ _ also on november 29 johnson established a panel headed by chief justice earl warren known as the warren commission through executive order to investigate kennedys assassination and surrounding conspiracies _ _
_ _ the commission conducted extensive research and hearings and unanimously concluded that lee harvey oswald acted alone in the assassination _ _
_ _ however the report remains controversial among some conspiracy theorists _ _
_ _ johnson retained senior kennedy appointees some for the full term of his presidency _ _
_ _ he even retained attorney general robert kennedy with whom he had a notoriously difficult relationship _ _
_ _ robert kennedy remained in office for a few months until leaving in 1964 to run for the senate _ _
_ _ although johnson had no official chief of staff walter jenkins was the first among a handful of equals and presided over the details of daily operations at the white house _ _
_ _ george reedy who was johnsons secondlongestserving aide assumed the post of press secretary when john f kennedys own pierre salinger left that post in march 1964 _ _
_ _ horace busby was another triplethreat man as johnson referred to his aides _ _
_ _ he served primarily as a speechwriter and political analyst _ _
_ _ bill moyers was the youngest member of johnsons staff he handled scheduling and speechwriting parttime _ _
_ _ the new president thought it advantageous to quickly pursue one of kennedys primary legislative goals—a tax cut _ _
_ _ johnson worked closely with harry f byrd of virginia to negotiate a reduction in the budget below 100 billion in exchange for what became overwhelming senate approval of the revenue act of 1964 _ _
_ _ congressional approval followed at the end of february and facilitated efforts to follow on civil rights _ _
_ _ in late 1963 johnson also launched the initial offensive of his war on poverty recruiting kennedy relative sargent shriver then head of the peace corps to spearhead the effort _ _
_ _ in march 1964 lbj sent to congress the economic opportunity act which created the job corps and the community action program designed to attack poverty locally _ _
_ _ the act also created vista volunteers in service to america a domestic counterpart to the peace corps _ _
_ _ president kennedy had submitted a civil rights bill to congress in june 1963 which was met with strong opposition _ _
_ _ johnson renewed the effort and asked bobby kennedy to spearhead the undertaking for the administration on capitol hill _ _
_ _ this provided adequate political cover for johnson should the effort fail but if it were successful johnson would receive ample credit _ _
_ _ historian robert caro notes that the bill kennedy had submitted was facing the same tactics that prevented the passage of civil rights bills in the past southern congressmen and senators used congressional procedure to prevent it from coming to a vote _ _
_ _ in particular they held up all of the major bills kennedy had proposed and that were considered urgent especially the tax reform bill to force the bills supporters to pull it _ _
_ _ johnson was quite familiar with the procedural tactic as he played a role in a similar tactic against a civil rights bill that harry truman had submitted to congress fifteen years earlier _ _
_ _ in that fight a rentcontrol renewal bill was held up until the civil rights bill was withdrawn _ _
_ _ believing that the current course meant that the civil rights act would suffer the same fate he adopted a different strategy from that of kennedy who had mostly removed himself from the legislative process _ _
_ _ by tackling the tax cut first the previous tactic was eliminated _ _
_ _ passing the civil rights bill in the house required getting it through the rules committee which had been holding it up in an attempt to kill it _ _
_ _ johnson decided on a campaign to use a discharge petition to force it onto the house floor _ _
_ _ facing a growing threat that they would be bypassed the house rules committee approved the bill and moved it to the floor of the full house which passed it shortly thereafter by a vote of 290–110 _ _
_ _ in the senate since the tax bill had passed three days earlier the anticivil rights senators were left with the filibuster as their only remaining tool _ _
_ _ overcoming the filibuster required the support of over twenty republicans who were growing less supportive because their party was about to nominate for president a candidate who opposed the bill _ _
_ _ according to caro johnson ultimately could convince republican leader everett dirksen to support the bill that amassed the necessary republican votes to overcome the filibuster in march 1964 after 75 hours of debate the bill passed the senate by a vote of 71–29 _ _
_ _ johnson signed the fortified civil rights act of 1964 into law on july 2 _ _
_ _ legend has it that the evening after signing the bill johnson told an aide i think we just delivered the south to the republican party for a long time to come anticipating a coming backlash from southern whites against johnsons democratic party _ _
_ _ biographer randall b _ _
_ _ woods has argued that johnson effectively used appeals to judeochristian ethics to garner support for the civil rights law _ _
_ _ woods writes that johnson undermined the southern filibuster against the bill _ _
_ _ lbj wrapped white america in a moral straitjacket _ _
_ _ how could individuals who fervently continuously and overwhelmingly identified themselves with a merciful and just god continue to condone racial discrimination police brutality and segregation _ _
_ _ where in the judeochristian ethic was there justification for killing young girls in a church in alabama denying an equal education to black children barring fathers and mothers from competing for jobs that would feed and clothe their families _ _
_ _ was jim crow to be americas response to godless communism _ _
_ _ woods states that johnsons religiosity ran deep at 15 he joined the disciples of christ or christian church and would forever believe that it was the duty of the rich to care for the poor the strong to assist the weak and the educated to speak for the inarticulate _ _
_ _ johnson shared the beliefs of his mentor fdr in that he paired liberal values to religious values believing that freedom and social justice served both god and man _ _
_ _ johnson wanted a catchy slogan for the 1964 campaign to describe his proposed domestic agenda for 1965 _ _
_ _ eric goldman who joined the white house in december of that year thought johnsons domestic program was best captured in the title of walter lippmans book the good society _ _
_ _ richard goodwin tweaked it to the great society and incorporated this in detail as part of a speech for johnson in may 1964 at the university of michigan _ _
_ _ it encompassed movements of urban renewal modern transportation clean environment antipoverty healthcare reform crime control and educational reform _ _
_ _ in spring 1964 johnson did not look optimistically upon the prospect of being elected president in his own right _ _
_ _ a pivotal change took place in april when he assumed personal management of negotiations between the railroad brotherhood and the railroad industry over the issue of featherbedding _ _
_ _ johnson emphasized to the parties the potential impact upon the economy of a strike _ _
_ _ after considerable horsetrading especially with the carriers who won promises from the president for greater freedom in setting rights and more liberal depreciation allowances from the irs johnson got an agreement _ _
_ _ this substantially boosted his selfconfidence as well as his image _ _
_ _ that same year robert f kennedy was widely considered an impeccable choice to run as johnsons vice presidential running mate but johnson and kennedy had never liked one another and johnson afraid that kennedy would be credited with his election as president abhorred the idea and opposed it at every turn _ _
_ _ kennedy was himself undecided about the position and knowing that the prospect rankled johnson was content to eliminate himself from consideration _ _
_ _ ultimately goldwaters poor polling numbers degraded any dependence johnson might have had on kennedy as his running mate _ _
_ _ hubert humphreys selection as vice president then became a foregone conclusion and was thought to strengthen johnson in the midwest and industrial northeast _ _
_ _ johnson knowing full well the degree of frustration inherent in the office of vice president put humphrey through a gauntlet of interviews to guarantee his absolute loyalty and having made the decision he kept the announcement from the press until the last moment to maximize media speculation and coverage _ _
_ _ in preparation for the democratic convention johnson requested the fbi send a squad of thirty agents to cover convention activities the objective of the squad was to inform the white house staff of any disruptive activities on the floor _ _
_ _ the squads focus narrowed upon the mississippi freedom democratic party mfdp delegation which sought to displace the white segregationist delegation regularly selected in the state _ _
_ _ the squads activities also included wiretaps of martin luther kings room as well as the student nonviolent coordinating committee sncc and the congress of racial equality core _ _
_ _ from beginning to end the squads assignment was carefully couched in terms of the monitoring of disruptive activities that might endanger the president and other highranking officials _ _
_ _ johnson was very concerned about potential political damage from media coverage of racial tensions exposed by a credentials fight between the mfdp and the segregationist delegation and he assigned humphrey the job of managing the problem _ _
_ _ the conventions credentials committee declared that two mfdp delegates in the delegation be seated as observers and agreed to bar future delegations from states where any citizens are deprived of the right to vote because of their race or color _ _
_ _ the mfdp rejected the committees ruling _ _
_ _ the convention became the apparent personal triumph that johnson craved but a sense of betrayal caused by the marginalization of the mfdp would trigger disaffection with johnson and the democratic party from the left sncc chairman john lewis would call it a turning point in the civil rights movement _ _
_ _ early in the 1964 presidential campaign barry goldwater appeared to be a strong contender with strong support from the south which threatened johnsons position as he had predicted in reaction to the passage of the civil rights act _ _
_ _ however goldwater lost momentum as his campaign progressed _ _
_ _ on september 7 1964 johnsons campaign managers broadcast the daisy ad _ _
_ _ it portrayed a little girl picking petals from a daisy counting up to ten _ _
_ _ then a baritone voice took over counted down from ten to zero and the visual showed the explosion of a nuclear bomb _ _
_ _ the message conveyed was that electing goldwater president held the danger of a nuclear war _ _
_ _ goldwaters campaign message was best symbolized by the bumper sticker displayed by supporters claiming in your heart you know hes right _ _
_ _ opponents captured the spirit of johnsons campaign with bumper stickers that said in your heart you know he might and in your guts you know hes nuts _ _
_ _ cia director william colby asserted that tracy barnes instructed the cia of the united states to spy on the goldwater campaign and the republican national committee to provide information to johnsons campaign _ _
_ _ johnson won the presidency by a landslide with 6105 percent of the vote making it the highest ever share of the popular vote _ _
_ _ at the time this was also the widest popular margin in the 20th century—more than 1595 million votes—this was later surpassed by incumbent president nixons victory in 1972 _ _
_ _ in the electoral college johnson defeated goldwater by a margin of 486 to 52 _ _
_ _ johnson won 44 states compared to goldwaters six _ _
_ _ voters also gave johnson the largest majorities in congress since fdrs election in 1936—a senate with a 68–32 majority and a house with a 295–140 democratic margin _ _
_ _ johnson began his elected presidential term with similar motives as he had upon succeeding to the office ready to carry forward the plans and programs of john fitzgerald kennedy _ _
_ _ not because of our sorrow or sympathy but because they are right _ _
_ _ he was reticent to push southern congressmen even further after passage of the civil rights act of 1964 and suspected their support may have been temporarily tapped out _ _
_ _ nevertheless the selma to montgomery marches in alabama led by martin luther king ultimately led johnson to initiate a debate on a voting rights bill in february 1965 _ _
_ _ johnson gave a congressional speech in which he said rarely at any time does an issue lay bare the secret heart of america itself  rarely are we met with the challenge  to the values and the purposes and the meaning of our beloved nation _ _
_ _ the issue of equal rights for american negroes is such an issue _ _
_ _ and should we defeat every enemy should we double our wealth and conquer the stars and still be unequal to this issue then we will have failed as a people and as a nation _ _
_ _ in 1965 he achieved passage of a second civil rights bill called the voting rights act which outlawed discrimination in voting thus allowing millions of southern blacks to vote for the first time _ _
_ _ under the act several states—eight of the eleven southern states of the former confederacy alabama south carolina north carolina tennessee georgia louisiana mississippi virginia—were subjected to the procedure of preclearance in 1965 while texas then home to the largest african american population of any state followed in 1975 _ _
_ _ the senate passed the voting rights bill by a vote of 77–19 after 2 12 months and it won passage in the house in july 333–85 _ _
_ _ the results were significant between the years of 1968 and 1980 the number of southern black elected state and federal officeholders nearly doubled _ _
_ _ the act also made a large difference in the numbers of black elected officials nationally a few hundred black officeholders in 1965 mushroomed to 6000 in 1989 _ _
_ _ after the murder of civil rights worker viola liuzzo johnson went on television to announce the arrest of four ku klux klansmen implicated in her death _ _
_ _ he angrily denounced the klan as a hooded society of bigots and warned them to return to a decent society before its too late _ _
_ _ johnson was the first president to arrest and prosecute members of the klan since ulysses s grant about 93 years earlier _ _
_ _ he turned to themes of christian redemption to push for civil rights thereby mobilizing support from churches north and south _ _
_ _ at the howard university commencement address on june 4 1965 he said that both the government and the nation needed to help achieve these goals to shatter forever not only the barriers of law and public practice but the walls which bound the condition of many by the color of his skin _ _
_ _ to dissolve as best we can the antique enmities of the heart which diminish the holder divide the great democracy and do wrong—great wrong—to the children of god _ _
_ _ in 1967 johnson nominated civil rights attorney thurgood marshall to be the first africanamerican justice of the supreme court _ _
_ _ to head the new department of housing and urban development johnson appointed robert c weaver the first africanamerican cabinet secretary in any us presidential administration _ _
_ _ in 1968 johnson signed the civil rights act of 1968 which provided for equal housing opportunities regardless of race creed or national origin _ _
_ _ the impetus for the laws passage came from the 1966 chicago open housing movement the april 4 1968 assassination of martin luther king jr and the civil unrest across the country following kings death _ _
_ _ on april 5 johnson wrote a letter to the united states house of representatives urging passage of the fair housing act _ _
_ _ with newly urgent attention from legislative director joseph califano and democratic speaker of the house john mccormack the bill which was previously stalled passed the house by a wide margin on april 10 _ _
_ _ with the passage of the sweeping immigration and nationality act of 1965 the countrys immigration system was reformed and all national origins quotas dating from the 1920s were removed _ _
_ _ the annual rate of inflow doubled between 1965 and 1970 and doubled again by 1990 with dramatic increases from asia and latin american countries including mexico _ _
_ _ scholars give johnson little credit for the law which was not one of his priorities he had supported the mccarren–walter act of 1952 that was unpopular with reformers _ _
_ _ johnson whose own ticket out of poverty was a public education in texas fervently believed that education was a cure for ignorance and poverty and was an essential component of the american dream especially for minorities who endured poor facilities and tightfisted budgets from local taxes _ _
_ _ he made education the top priority of the great society agenda with an emphasis on helping poor children _ _
_ _ after the 1964 landslide brought in many new liberal congressmen lbj launched a legislative effort that took the name of the elementary and secondary education act esea of 1965 _ _
_ _ the bill sought to double federal spending on education from 4 billion to 8 billion with considerable facilitating by the white house it passed the house by a vote of 263 to 153 on march 26 and then it remarkably passed without a change in the senate by 73 to 8 without going through the usual conference committee _ _
_ _ this was a historic accomplishment by the president with the billiondollar bill passing as introduced just 87 days before _ _
_ _ for the first time large amounts of federal money went to public schools _ _
_ _ in practice esea meant helping all public school districts with more money going to districts that had large proportions of students from poor families which included all the big cities _ _
_ _ for the first time private schools most of them catholic schools in the inner cities received services such as library funding comprising about 12 percent of the esea budget _ _
_ _ though federal funds were involved they were administered by local officials and by 1977 it was reported that less than half of the funds were applied toward the education of children under the poverty line _ _
_ _ dallek further reports that researchers cited by hugh davis graham soon found that poverty had more to do with family background and neighborhood conditions than the quantity of education a child received _ _
_ _ early studies suggested initial improvements for poor children helped by esea reading and math programs but later assessments indicated that benefits faded quickly and left pupils little better off than those not in the schemes _ _
_ _ johnsons second major education program was the higher education act of 1965 which focused on funding for lowerincome students including grants workstudy money and government loans _ _
_ _ although esea solidified johnsons support among k12 teachers unions neither the higher education act nor the new endowments mollified the college professors and students growing increasingly uneasy with the war in vietnam _ _
_ _ in 1967 johnson signed the public broadcasting act to create educational television programs to supplement the broadcast networks _ _
_ _ in 1965 johnson also set up the national endowment for the humanities and the national endowment for the arts to support academic subjects such as literature history and law and arts such as music painting and sculpture as the wpa once did _ _
_ _ in 1964 at johnsons request congress passed the revenue act of 1964 and the economic opportunity act as part of the war on poverty _ _
_ _ johnson set in motion legislation creating programs such as head start food stamps and work study _ _
_ _ during johnsons years in office national poverty declined significantly with the percentage of americans living below the poverty line dropping from 23 percent to 12 percent _ _
_ _ johnson took an additional step in the war on poverty with an urban renewal effort presenting to congress in january 1966 the demonstration cities program _ _
_ _ to be eligible a city would need to demonstrate its readiness to arrest blight and decay and make a substantial impact on the development of its entire city _ _
_ _ johnson requested an investment of 400 million per year totaling 24 billion _ _
_ _ in the fall of 1966 the congress passed a substantially reduced program costing 900 million which johnson later called the model cities program _ _
_ _ changing the name had little effect on the success of the bill the new york times wrote 22 years later that the program was for the most part a failure _ _
_ _ johnsons initial effort to improve healthcare was the creation of the commission on heart disease cancer and strokes hdcs _ _
_ _ combined these diseases accounted for 71 percent of the nations deaths in 1962 _ _
_ _ to enact recommendations of the commission johnson asked congress for funds to set up the regional medical program rmp to create a network of hospitals with federally funded research and practice congress passed a significantly watereddown version _ _
_ _ as a backup position in 1965 johnson turned his focus to hospital insurance for the aged under social security _ _
_ _ the key player in initiating this program named medicare was wilbur mills chairman of the house ways and means committee _ _
_ _ to reduce republican opposition mills suggested that medicare be fashioned as a threelayer cake hospital insurance under social security a voluntary insurance program for doctor visits and an expanded medical welfare program for the poor known as medicaid _ _
_ _ the bill passed the house by a margin of 110 votes on april 8 _ _
_ _ the effort in the senate was considerably more complicated however the medicare bill passed congress on july 28 after negotiation in a conference committee _ _
_ _ medicare now covers tens of millions of americans _ _
_ _ johnson gave the first two medicare cards to former president harry s truman and his wife bess after signing the medicare bill at the truman library in independence missouri _ _
_ _ in march 1965 johnson sent to congress a transportation message which included the creation of a new transportation department which would include the commerce departments office of transportation the bureau of public roads the federal aviation agency the coast guard the maritime administration the civil aeronautics board and the interstate commerce commission _ _
_ _ the bill passed the senate after some negotiation over navigation projects in the house passage required negotiation over maritime interests and the bill was signed october 15 1965 _ _
_ _ though johnson had already introduced a gun control bill on june 6 1968 after the assassination of robert kennedy lady bird johnsons press secretary liz carpenter in a memo to the president worried that the country had been brainwashed by high drama and that johnson need some quick dramatic actions that addressed the issue of violence _ _
_ _ in october johnson signed the gun control act of 1968 into law but did not invoke the memory of robert kennedy as he had so often done with his brother–an omission the historian jeff shesol has argued was motivated by johnsons longstanding contempt for robert _ _
_ _ during johnsons administration nasa conducted the gemini manned space program developed the saturn v rocket and its launch facility and prepared to make the first manned apollo program flights _ _
_ _ on january 27 1967 the nation was stunned when the entire crew of apollo 1 was killed in a cabin fire during a spacecraft test on the launch pad stopping apollo in its tracks _ _
_ _ rather than appointing another warrenstyle commission johnson accepted administrator james e webbs request for nasa to do its investigation holding itself accountable to congress and the president _ _
_ _ johnson maintained his staunch support of apollo through congressional and press controversy and the program recovered _ _
_ _ the first two manned missions apollo 7 and the first manned flight to the moon apollo 8 were completed by the end of johnsons term _ _
_ _ he congratulated the apollo 8 crew saying youve taken  all of us all over the world into a new era _ _
_ _ on july 16 1969 johnson attended the launch of the first moon landing mission apollo 11 becoming the first former or incumbent us president to witness a rocket launch _ _
_ _ major riots in black neighborhoods caused a series of long hot summers _ _
_ _ they started with a violent disturbance in the harlem riots in 1964 and the watts district of los angeles in 1965 and extended to 1971 _ _
_ _ the momentum for the advancement of civil rights came to a sudden halt in the summer of 1965 with the riots in watts _ _
_ _ after 34 people were killed and 35 million equivalent to 30096 million in 2021 in the property was damaged the public feared an expansion of the violence to other cities and so the appetite for additional programs in lbjs agenda was lost _ _
_ _ newark burned in 1967 where six days of rioting left 26 dead 1500 injured and the inner city a burnedout shell _ _
_ _ in detroit in 1967 governor george romney sent in 7400 national guard troops to quell fire bombings looting and attacks on businesses and police _ _
_ _ johnson finally sent in federal troops with tanks and machine guns _ _
_ _ detroit continued to burn for three more days until finally 43 were dead 2250 were injured 4000 were arrested property damage ranged into the hundreds of millions _ _
_ _ the biggest wave of riots came in april 1968 in over a hundred cities after the assassination of martin luther king _ _
_ _ johnson called for even more billions to be spent in the cities and another federal civil rights law regarding housing but this request had little congressional support _ _
_ _ johnsons popularity plummeted as a massive white political backlash took shape reinforcing the sense johnson had lost control of the streets of major cities as well as his party _ _
_ _ johnson created the kerner commission to study the problem of urban riots headed by illinois governor otto kerner _ _
_ _ according to press secretary george christian johnson was unsurprised by the riots saying what did you expect _ _
_ _ i dont know why were so surprised _ _
_ _ when you put your foot on a mans neck and hold him down for three hundred years and then you let him up whats he going to do _ _
_ _ hes going to knock your block off _ _
_ _ as a result of rioting in washington dc after the murder of dr martin luther king jr  president johnson determined that a condition of domestic violence and disorder existed and issued a proclamation and executive order mobilizing combatequipped troops _ _
_ _ the new york times reported that 4000 regular army and national guard troops entered into the nations capital to try to end riotous looting burglarizing and burning by roving bands of negro youths _ _
_ _ some of the troops were sent to guard the capital and the white house _ _
_ _ in 1966 the press sensed a credibility gap between what johnson was saying in press conferences and what was happening on the ground in vietnam which led to much less favorable coverage _ _
_ _ by years end the democratic governor of missouri warren e hearnes warned that johnson would lose the state by 100000 votes despite winning by a margin of 500000 in 1964 _ _
_ _ frustration over vietnam too much federal spending and  taxation no great public support for your great society programs and  public disenchantment with the civil rights programs had eroded the presidents standing the governor reported _ _
_ _ there were bright spots in january 1967 johnson boasted that wages were the highest in history unemployment was at a 13year low and corporate profits and farm incomes were greater than ever a 45 percent jump in consumer prices was worrisome as was the rise in interest rates _ _
_ _ johnson asked for a temporary 6 percent surcharge in income taxes to cover the mounting deficit caused by increased spending _ _
_ _ johnsons approval ratings stayed below 50 percent by january 1967 the number of his strong supporters had plunged to 16 percent from 25 percent four months before _ _
_ _ he ran about even with republican george romney in trial matchups that spring _ _
_ _ asked to explain why he was unpopular johnson responded i am a dominating personality and when i get things done i dont always please all the people _ _
_ _ johnson also blamed the press saying they showed complete irresponsibility and lie and misstate facts and have no one to be answerable to _ _
_ _ he also blamed the preachers liberals and professors who had turned against him _ _
_ _ in the congressional elections of 1966 the republicans gained three seats in the senate and 47 in the house reinvigorating the conservative coalition and making it more difficult for johnson to pass any additional great society legislation _ _
_ _ however in the end congress passed almost 96 percent of the administrations great society programs which johnson then signed into law _ _
_ _ at kennedys death there were 16000 american military personnel stationed in vietnam supporting south vietnam in the war against north vietnam _ _
_ _ vietnam had been partitioned at the 1954 geneva conference into two countries with north vietnam led by a communist government _ _
_ _ johnson subscribed to the domino theory in vietnam and to a containment policy that required america to make a serious effort to stop all communist expansion _ _
_ _ on taking office johnson immediately reversed kennedys order to withdraw 1000 military personnel by the end of 1963 _ _
_ _ in late summer 1964 johnson seriously questioned the value of staying in vietnam but after meeting with secretary of state dean rusk and chairman of the joint chiefs of staff maxwell d taylor declared his readiness to do more when we had a base or when saigon was politically more stable _ _
_ _ he expanded the numbers and roles of the american military following the gulf of tonkin incident _ _
_ _ citation needed _ _
_ _ in august 1964 allegations arose from the military that two us destroyers had been attacked by some north vietnamese torpedo boats in international waters 40 miles 64 km from the vietnamese coast in the gulf of tonkin naval communications and reports of the attack were contradictory _ _
_ _ although johnson very much wanted to keep discussions about vietnam out of the 1964 election campaign he felt forced to respond to the supposed aggression by the vietnamese so he sought and obtained from the congress the gulf of tonkin resolution on august 7 _ _
_ _ johnson was determined to embolden his image on foreign policy and also wanted to prevent criticism such as truman had received in korea by proceeding without congressional endorsement of military action _ _
_ _ responding to the purported attack would also blunt presidential campaign criticism of weakness from the hawkish goldwater camp _ _
_ _ the resolution gave congressional approval for use of military force by the commanderinchief to repel future attacks and also to assist members of seato requesting assistance _ _
_ _ johnson later in the campaign expressed assurance that the primary us goal remained the preservation of south vietnamese independence through material and advice as opposed to any us offensive posture _ _
_ _ the publics reaction to the resolution at the time was positive—48 percent favored stronger measures in vietnam and only 14 percent wanted to negotiate a settlement and leave _ _
_ _ in the 1964 presidential campaign johnson restated his determination to provide measured support for vietnam while avoiding another korea but privately he had a sense of foreboding about vietnam—a feeling that no matter what he did things would end badly _ _
_ _ indeed his heart was on his great society agenda and he even felt that his political opponents favored greater intervention in vietnam to divert attention and resources away from his war on poverty _ _
_ _ the situation on the ground was aggravated in the fall by additional viet minh attacks on us ships in the tonkin gulf as well as an attack on bien hoa air base in south vietnam _ _
_ _ johnson decided against retaliatory action at the time after consultation with the joint chiefs and also after public pollster lou harris confirmed that his decision would not detrimentally affect him at the polls _ _
_ _ by the end of 1964 there were approximately 23000 military personnel in south vietnam us casualties for 1964 totaled 1278 _ _
_ _ in the winter of 1964–1965 johnson was pressured by the military to begin a bombing campaign to forcefully resist a communist takeover in south vietnam moreover a plurality in the polls at the time was in favor of military action against the communists with only 26 to 30 percent opposed _ _
_ _ johnson revised his priorities and a new preference for stronger action came at the end of january with yet another change of government in saigon _ _
_ _ he then agreed with mac bundy and mcnamara that the continued passive role would only lead to defeat and withdrawal in humiliation _ _
_ _ johnson said stable government or no stable government in saigon we will do what we ought to do _ _
_ _ im prepared to do that we will move strongly _ _
_ _ general nguyễn khánh head of the new government is our boy _ _
_ _ johnson decided on a systematic bombing campaign in february after a ground report from bundy recommending immediate us action to avoid defeat also the viet cong had just killed eight us advisers and wounded dozens of others in an attack at pleiku air base _ _
_ _ the eightweek bombing campaign became known as operation rolling thunder _ _
_ _ johnsons instructions for public consumption were clear there was to be no comment that the war effort had been expanded _ _
_ _ longterm estimates of the bombing campaign ranged from an expectation that hanoi would rein in the viet cong to one of provoking hanoi and the viet cong into an intensification of the war _ _
_ _ but the shortterm expectations were consistent that the morale and stability of the south vietnamese government would be bolstered _ _
_ _ by limiting the information given out to the public and even to congress johnson maximized his flexibility to change course _ _
_ _ in march bundy began to urge the use of ground forces—air operations alone he counseled would not stop hanois aggression against the south _ _
_ _ johnson approved an increase in logistical troops of 18000 to 20000 and the deployment of two additional marine battalions and a marine air squadron in addition to planning for the deployment of two more divisions _ _
_ _ more significantly he also authorized a change in mission from defensive to offensive operations he nevertheless continued to insist that this was not to be publicly represented as a change in existing policy _ _
_ _ by the middle of june the total us ground forces in vietnam have increased to 82000 or by 150 percent _ _
_ _ that same month ambassador taylor reported that the bombing offensive against north vietnam had been ineffective and that the south vietnamese army was outclassed and in danger of collapse _ _
_ _ general westmoreland shortly thereafter recommended the president further increase ground troops from 82000 to 175000 _ _
_ _ after consulting with his principals johnson desirous of a low profile chose to announce at a press conference an increase to 125000 troops with additional forces to be sent later upon request _ _
_ _ johnson described himself at the time as boxed in by unpalatable choices—between sending americans to die in vietnam and giving in to the communists _ _
_ _ if he sent additional troops he would be attacked as an interventionist and if he did not he thought he risked being impeached _ _
_ _ he continued to insist that his decision did not imply any change in policy whatsoever _ _
_ _ of his desire to veil the decision johnson jested privately if you have a motherinlaw with only one eye and she has it in the center of her forehead you dont keep her in the living room _ _
_ _ by october 1965 there were over 200000 troops deployed in vietnam _ _
_ _ johnson underwent surgery on november 8 1965 at the bethesda naval hospital to remove his gallbladder and a kidney stone _ _
_ _ afterward his doctors reported that the president had come through the surgery beautifully as expected he was able to resume his duties the next day _ _
_ _ he met with reporters a couple of days later and reassured the nation that he was recovering well _ _
_ _ although johnson was incapacitated during surgery there was no transfer of presidential power to vice president humphrey as no constitutional procedure to do so existed at the time _ _
_ _ the twentyfifth amendment which congress had sent to the states for ratification four months earlier included procedures for the orderly transfer of power in the case of presidential incapacity but was not ratified until 1967 _ _
_ _ public and political impatience with the war began to emerge in the spring of 1966 and johnsons approval ratings reached a new low of 41 percent _ _
_ _ sen richard russell chairman of the armed services committee reflected the national mood in june 1966 when he declared it was time to get it over or get out _ _
_ _ johnson responded by saying to the press we are trying to provide the maximum deterrence that we can to communist aggression with a minimum of cost _ _
_ _ in response to the intensified criticism of the war effort johnson raised suspicions of communist subversion in the country and press relations became strained _ _
_ _ johnsons primary war policy opponent in congress was the chairman of the foreign relations committee james william fulbright who convened a series of public hearings in february to question a range of experts on the progress of the war _ _
_ _ the persistent johnson began to seriously consider a more focused bombing campaign against petroleum oil and lubrication facilities in north vietnam in hopes of accelerating victory _ _
_ _ humphrey rusk and mcnamara all agreed and the bombing began at the end of june _ _
_ _ in july polling results indicated that americans favored the bombing campaign by a fivetoone margin however in august a defense department study indicated that the bombing campaign had little impact on north vietnam _ _
_ _ in the fall of 1966 multiple sources began to report that progress was being made against the north vietnamese logistics and infrastructure johnson was urged from every corner to begin peace discussions _ _
_ _ there was no shortage of peace initiatives nevertheless among protesters english philosopher bertrand russell attacked johnsons policy as a barbaric aggressive war of conquest and in june he initiated the international war crimes tribunal as a means to condemn the american effort _ _
_ _ the gap with hanoi was an unbridgeable demand on both sides for a unilateral end to bombing and withdrawal of forces _ _
_ _ in august johnson appointed averell harriman ambassador for peace to promote negotiations _ _
_ _ westmoreland and mcnamara then recommended a concerted program to promote pacification johnson formally placed this effort under military control in october _ _
_ _ also in october 1966 to reassure and promote his war effort johnson initiated a meeting with allies in manila—the south vietnamese thais south koreans filipinos australians and new zealanders _ _
_ _ the conference ended with pronouncements to stand fast against communist aggression and to promote ideals of democracy and development in vietnam and across asia _ _
_ _ for johnson it was a fleeting public relations success—confirmed by a 63 percent vietnam approval rating in november _ _
_ _ nevertheless in december johnsons vietnam approval rating was again back down in the 40s lbj had become anxious to justify war casualties and talked of the need for a decisive victory despite the unpopularity of the cause _ _
_ _ in a discussion about the war with former president dwight eisenhower on october 3 1966 johnson said he was trying to win it just as fast as i can in every way that i know how and later stated that he needed all the help i can get _ _
_ _ by years end it was clear that current pacification efforts were ineffectual as had been the air campaign _ _
_ _ johnson then agreed to mcnamaras new recommendation to add 70000 troops in 1967 to the 400000 previously committed _ _
_ _ while mcnamara recommended no increase in the level of bombing johnson agreed with cia recommendations to increase them _ _
_ _ the increased bombing began despite initial secret talks being held in saigon hanoi and warsaw _ _
_ _ while the bombing ended the talks north vietnamese intentions were not considered genuine _ _
_ _ in january and february 1967 probes were made to assess north vietnameses willingness to discuss peace but they fell on deaf ears _ _
_ _ ho chi minh declared that the only solution was a unilateral withdrawal by the us a gallup poll taken in july 1967 showed that 52 percent of the country disapproved of the presidents handling of the war and only 34 percent thought progress was being made _ _
_ _ johnsons anger and frustration over the lack of a solution to vietnam and its effect on him politically was exhibited in a statement to robert f kennedy who had become a prominent public critic of the war and loomed as a potential challenger in the 1968 presidential election _ _
_ _ johnson had just received several reports predicting military progress by the summer and warned kennedy ill destroy you and every one of your dove friends in six months he shouted _ _
_ _ youll be dead politically in six months _ _
_ _ mcnamara offered johnson a way out of vietnam in may the administration could declare its objective in the war—south vietnams selfdetermination—was being achieved and the upcoming september elections in south vietnam would provide the chance for a coalition government _ _
_ _ the united states could reasonably expect that country to then assume responsibility for the election outcome _ _
_ _ but johnson was reluctant in light of some optimistic reports again of questionable reliability which matched the negative assessments about the conflict and provided hope for improvement _ _
_ _ the cia was reporting wide food shortages in hanoi and an unstable power grid as well as military manpower reductions _ _
_ _ by the middle of 1967 nearly 70000 americans had been killed or wounded in the war _ _
_ _ in july johnson sent mcnamara wheeler and other officials to meet with westmoreland and reach an agreement on plans for the immediate future _ _
_ _ at that time the war was being commonly described by the press and others as a stalemate _ _
_ _ westmoreland said such a description was pure fiction and that we are winning slowly but steadily and the pace can excel if we reinforce our successes _ _
_ _ though westmoreland sought many more johnson agreed to an increase of 55000 troops bringing the total to 525000 _ _
_ _ in august johnson with the joint chiefs support decided to expand the air campaign and exempted only hanoi haiphong and a buffer zone with china from the target list _ _
_ _ in september ho chi minh and north vietnamese premier pham van dong appeared amenable to french mediation so johnson ceased bombing in a 10mile zone around hanoi this was met with dissatisfaction _ _
_ _ in a texas speech johnson agreed to halt all bombing if ho chi minh would launch productive and meaningful discussions and if north vietnam would not seek to take advantage of the halt this was named the san antonio formula _ _
_ _ there was no response but johnson pursued the possibility of negotiations with such a bombing pause _ _
_ _ with the war still arguably in a stalemate and light of the widespread disapproval of the conflict johnson convened a group called the wise men for a fresh indepth look at the war—dean acheson general omar bradley george ball mac bundy arthur dean douglas dillon abe fortas averell harriman henry cabot lodge robert murphy and max taylor _ _
_ _ at that time mcnamara reversing his position on the war recommended that a cap of 525000 is placed on the number of forces deployed and that the bombing be halted since he could see no success _ _
_ _ johnson was quite agitated by this recommendation and mcnamaras resignation soon followed _ _
_ _ except for george ball the wise men all agreed the administration should press forward _ _
_ _ johnson was confident that hanoi would await the 1968 us election results before deciding to negotiate _ _
_ _ on june 23 1967 johnson traveled to los angeles for a democratic fundraiser _ _
_ _ thousands of antiwar protesters tried to march past the hotel where he was speaking _ _
_ _ the march was led by a coalition of peace protestors _ _
_ _ however a small group of progressive labor party and sds protestors activists placed themselves at the head of the march and when they reached the hotel staged a sitdown _ _
_ _ efforts by march monitors to keep the main body of the marchers moving were only partially successful _ _
_ _ hundreds of lapd officers were massed at the hotel and when the march slowed an order was given to disperse the crowd _ _
_ _ the riot act was read and 51 protestors arrested _ _
_ _ this was one of the first massive war protests in the united states and the first in los angeles _ _
_ _ ending in a clash with riot police it set a pattern for the massive protests which followed _ _
_ _ due to the size and violence of this event johnson attempted no further public speeches in venues outside military bases _ _
_ _ in october with the everincreasing public protests against the war johnson engaged the fbi and the cia to investigate monitor and undermine antiwar activists _ _
_ _ in midoctober there was a demonstration of 100000 at the pentagon johnson and rusk were convinced that foreign communist sources were behind the demonstration which was refuted by cia findings _ _
_ _ as casualties mounted and success seemed further away than ever johnsons popularity plummeted _ _
_ _ college students and others protested burned draft cards and chanted hey hey lbj how many kids did you kill today _ _
_ _ johnson could scarcely travel anywhere without facing protests and was not allowed by the secret service to attend the 1968 democratic national convention where thousands of hippies yippies black panthers and other opponents of johnsons policies both in vietnam and in the ghettos converged to protest _ _
_ _ thus by 1968 the public was polarized with the hawks rejecting johnsons refusal to continue the war indefinitely and the doves rejecting his current war policies _ _
_ _ support for johnsons middle position continued to shrink until he finally rejected containment and sought a peace settlement _ _
_ _ by late summer he realized that nixon was closer to his position than humphrey _ _
_ _ he continued to support humphrey publicly in the election and personally despised nixon _ _
_ _ one of johnsons wellknown quotes was the democratic party at its worst is still better than the republican party at its best _ _
_ _ on january 30 the viet cong and north vietnamese launched the tet offensive against south vietnams five largest cities including saigon and the us embassy there and other government installations _ _
_ _ while the tet offensive failed militarily it was a psychological victory definitively turning american public opinion against the war effort _ _
_ _ iconically walter cronkite of cbs news voted the nations most trusted person in february opined on the air that the conflict was deadlocked and that additional fighting would change nothing _ _
_ _ johnson reacted saying if ive lost cronkite ive lost middle america _ _
_ _ indeed demoralization about the war was everywhere 26 percent then approved of johnsons handling of vietnam 63 percent disapproved _ _
_ _ johnson agreed to increase the troop level by 22000 despite a recommendation from the joint chiefs for ten times that number _ _
_ _ by march 1968 johnson was secretly desperate for an honorable way out of the war _ _
_ _ clark clifford the new defense secretary described the war as a loser and proposed to cut losses and get out _ _
_ _ on march 31 johnson spoke to the nation of steps to limit the war in vietnam _ _
_ _ he then announced an immediate unilateral halt to the bombing of north vietnam and announced his intention to seek out peace talks anywhere at any time _ _
_ _ at the close of his speech he also announced i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president _ _
_ _ in march johnson decided to restrict future bombing with the result that 75 percent of north vietnams territory containing 90 percent of its population was offlimits to bombing _ _
_ _ in april he succeeded in opening discussions of peace talks and after extensive negotiations over the site paris was agreed to and talks began in may _ _
_ _ when the talks failed to yield any results the decision was made to resort to private discussions in paris _ _
_ _ two months later it was apparent that private discussions proved to be no more productive _ _
_ _ despite recommendations in august from harriman vance clifford and bundy to halt bombing as an incentive for hanoi to seriously engage in substantive peace talks johnson refused _ _
_ _ in october when the parties came close to an agreement on a bombing halt republican presidential nominee richard nixon intervened with the south vietnamese making promises of better terms to delay a settlement on the issue until after the election _ _
_ _ after the election johnsons primary focus on vietnam was to get saigon to join the paris peace talks _ _
_ _ ironically only after nixon added his urging did they do so _ _
_ _ even then they argued about procedural matters until after nixon took office _ _
_ _ in a 1993 interview for the johnson presidential library oral history archives johnsons secretary of defense robert mcnamara stated that a carrier battle group the us 6th fleet sent on a training exercise toward gibraltar was repositioned back towards the eastern mediterranean to be able to assist israel during the sixday war of june 1967 _ _
_ _ given the rapid israeli advances following their strike on egypt the administration thought the situation was so tense in israel that perhaps the syrians fearing israel would attack them or the soviets supporting the syrians might wish to redress the balance of power and might attack israel _ _
_ _ the soviets learned of this course correction and regarded it as an offensive move _ _
_ _ in a hotline message from moscow soviet premier alexei kosygin said if you want war youre going to get war _ _
_ _ the soviet union supported its arab allies _ _
_ _ in may 1967 the soviets started a surge deployment of their naval forces into the east mediterranean _ _
_ _ early in the crisis they began to shadow the us and british carriers with destroyers and intelligence collecting vessels _ _
_ _ the soviet naval squadron in the mediterranean was sufficiently strong to act as a major restraint on the us _ _
_ _ navy _ _
_ _ in a 1983 interview with the boston globe mcnamara claimed that we damn near had war _ _
_ _ he said kosygin was angry that we had turned around a carrier in the mediterranean _ _
_ _ johnson continued the fbis wiretapping of martin luther king jr that had been previously authorized by the kennedy administration under attorney general robert f _ _
_ _ kennedy _ _
_ _ as a result of listening to the fbis tapes remarks on kings extramarital activities were made by several prominent officials including johnson who once said that king was a hypocritical preacher _ _
_ _ this was despite the fact that johnson himself had multiple extramarital affairs _ _
_ _ johnson also authorized the tapping of phone conversations of others including the vietnamese friends of a nixon associate _ _
_ _ johnson made eleven international trips to twenty countries during his presidency _ _
_ _ he flew five hundred twentythree thousand miles 841690 km aboard air force one while in office _ _
_ _ his october 1966 visit to australia sparked demonstrations from antiwar protesters _ _
_ _ one of the most unusual international trips in presidential history occurred before christmas in 1967 _ _
_ _ the president began the trip by going to the memorial service for australian prime minister harold holt who had disappeared in a swimming accident and was presumed drowned _ _
_ _ the white house did not reveal in advance to the press that the president would make the first roundtheworld presidential trip _ _
_ _ the trip was twentysix thousand nine hundred fiftynine miles 433863 km completed in only 1125 hours 47 days _ _
_ _ air force one crossed the equator twice stopped at travis air force base in honolulu pago pago canberra melbourne vietnam karachi and rome _ _
_ _ as he had served less than 24 months of president kennedys term johnson was constitutionally permitted to run for a second full term in the 1968 presidential election under the provisions of the 22nd amendment _ _
_ _ initially no prominent democratic candidate was prepared to run against a sitting president of the democratic party _ _
_ _ only senator eugene mccarthy of minnesota challenged johnson as an antiwar candidate in the new hampshire primary hoping to pressure the democrats to oppose the vietnam war _ _
_ _ on march 12 mccarthy won 42 percent of the primary vote to johnsons 49 percent an amazingly strong showing for such a challenger _ _
_ _ four days later senator robert f kennedy of new york entered the race _ _
_ _ internal polling by johnsons campaign in wisconsin the next state to hold a primary election showed the president trailing badly _ _
_ _ johnson did not leave the white house to campaign _ _
_ _ by this time johnson had lost control of the democratic party which was splitting into four generally antagonistic factions _ _
_ _ the first consisted of johnson and humphrey labor unions and local party bosses led by chicago mayor richard j daley _ _
_ _ the second group consisted of students and intellectuals who were vociferously against the war and rallied behind mccarthy _ _
_ _ the third group was catholics hispanics and african americans who rallied behind robert kennedy _ _
_ _ the fourth group was traditionally segregationist white southerners who rallied behind george c wallace and the american independent party _ _
_ _ vietnam was one of many issues that splintered the party and johnson could see no way to win the war and no way to unite the party long enough for him to win reelection _ _
_ _ also although it was not made public at the time johnson had become more worried about his failing health and was concerned that he might not live through another fouryear term _ _
_ _ in 1967 he secretly commissioned an actuarial study that accurately predicted he would die at 64 _ _
_ _ in early january 1968 johnson asked former speechwriter horace busby to draft a withdrawal statement that he could put into his upcoming state of the union address but the president did not include it _ _
_ _ two months later however spurred by his health concerns and by a growing realization that his political capital was all but gone johnson again considered withdrawing discussing the possibility with joseph califano and harry mcpherson on march 28 _ _
_ _ three days later he shocked the nation when he announced he would not run for reelection by concluding with the line i shall not seek and i will not accept the nomination of my party for another term as your president _ _
_ _ the next day the presidents approval ratings increased from 36 percent to 49 percent _ _
_ _ historians have debated the factors that led to johnsons surprise decision _ _
_ _ shesol says johnson wanted out of the white house but also wanted vindication when the indicators turned negative he decided to leave _ _
_ _ gould says that johnson had neglected the party was hurting it by his vietnam policies and underestimated mccarthys strength until the last minute when it was too late for johnson to recover _ _
_ _ woods says johnson realized he needed to leave for the nation to heal _ _
_ _ dallek says that johnson had no further domestic goals and realized that his personality had eroded his popularity _ _
_ _ his health was not good and he was preoccupied with the kennedy campaign his wife was pressing for his retirement and his base of support continued to shrink _ _
_ _ leaving the race would allow him to pose as a peacemaker _ _
_ _ bennett however says johnson had been forced out of a reelection race in 1968 by outrage over his policy in southeast asia _ _
_ _ after robert kennedys assassination johnson rallied the party bosses and unions to give humphrey the nomination at the 1968 democratic national convention _ _
_ _ personal correspondences between the president and some in the republican party suggested johnson tacitly supported nelson rockefellers campaign _ _
_ _ he reportedly said that if rockefeller became the republican nominee he would not campaign against him and would not campaign for humphrey _ _
_ _ in what was termed the october surprise johnson announced to the nation on october 31 1968 that he had ordered a complete cessation of all air naval and artillery bombardment of north vietnam effective november 1 should the hanoi government be willing to negotiate and citing progress with the paris peace talks _ _
_ _ in the end democrats did not fully unite behind humphrey enabling republican candidate richard nixon to win the election _ _
_ _ johnson appointed justices abe fortas 1965 and thurgood marshall 1967 to the supreme court of the united states _ _
_ _ johnson anticipated court challenges to his legislative measures in 1965 and thought it advantageous to have a mole in the supreme court who he thought could provide him with inside information as he was able to get from the legislative branch _ _
_ _ abe fortas in particular was the individual that johnson thought could fill the bill _ _
_ _ the opportunity arose when an opening occurred for ambassador to the un with adlai stevensons death associate justice arthur goldberg accepted johnsons offer to transfer to the un position _ _
_ _ johnson insisted on fortas assuming goldbergs seat over fortass wifes objection that it was too early in his career _ _
_ _ she expressed disapproval to johnson personally afterward _ _
_ _ when earl warren announced his retirement in 1968 johnson nominated fortas to succeed him as chief justice of the united states and nominated homer thornberry to succeed fortas as associate justice _ _
_ _ however fortass nomination was filibustered by senators and neither nominee was voted upon by the full senate _ _
_ _ on inauguration day january 20 1969 johnson saw nixon sworn in then got on the plane to fly back to texas _ _
_ _ when the front door of the plane closed johnson pulled out a cigarette—his first cigarette he had smoked since his heart attack in 1955 _ _
_ _ one of his daughters pulled it out of his mouth and said daddy what are you doing _ _
_ _ youre going to kill yourself _ _
_ _ he took it back and said ive now raised you girls _ _
_ _ ive now been president _ _
_ _ now its my time _ _
_ _ from that point on he went into a very selfdestructive spiral _ _
_ _ after leaving the presidency in january 1969 johnson went home to his ranch in stonewall texas accompanied by a former aide and speechwriter harry j middleton who would draft johnsons first book the choices we face and work with him on his memoirs entitled the vantage point perspectives of the presidency 1963–1969 published in 1971 _ _
_ _ that year the lyndon baines johnson library and museum opened on the campus of the university of texas at austin _ _
_ _ he donated his texas ranch in his will to the public to form the lyndon b johnson national historical park with the provision that the ranch remain a working ranch and not become a sterile relic of the past _ _
_ _ johnson gave nixon high grades in foreign policy but worried that his successor was being pressured into removing us forces too quickly from south vietnam before the south vietnamese were able to defend themselves _ _
_ _ if the south falls to the communists we can have a serious backlash here at home he warned _ _
_ _ during the 1972 presidential election johnson reluctantly endorsed democratic presidential nominee george mcgovern a senator from south dakota mcgovern had long opposed johnsons foreign and defense policies _ _
_ _ the mcgovern nomination and presidential platform dismayed him _ _
_ _ nixon could be defeated johnson insisted if only the democrats dont go too far left _ _
_ _ johnson had felt edmund muskie would be more likely to defeat nixon however he declined an invitation to try to stop mcgovern receiving the nomination as he felt his unpopularity within the democratic party was such that anything he said was more likely to help mcgovern _ _
_ _ johnsons protégé john connally had served as president nixons secretary of the treasury and then stepped down to head democrats for nixon a group funded by republicans _ _
_ _ it was the first time that connally and johnson were on opposite sides of a general election campaign _ _
_ _ in march 1970 johnson suffered an attack of angina and was taken to brooke army general hospital in san antonio _ _
_ _ he had gained more than 25 pounds 11 kg since leaving the white house he now weighed around 235 pounds 107 kg and was urged to lose considerable weight _ _
_ _ he had also resumed smoking after nearly 15 years of not smoking _ _
_ _ the following summer again gripped by chest pains he lost 15 pounds 68 kg in less than a month on a crash diet _ _
_ _ in april 1972 johnson had a second heart attack while visiting his daughter lynda in virginia _ _
_ _ im hurting real bad he confided to friends _ _
_ _ the chest pains returned nearly every afternoon‍—‌a series of sharp jolting pains that left him frightened and breathless _ _
_ _ a portable oxygen tank was kept by his bed and he periodically interrupted what he was doing to lie down and don the mask _ _
_ _ he continued to smoke heavily and although nominally living on a lowcalorie lowcholesterol diet kept to it only intermittently _ _
_ _ meanwhile he began to experience severe abdominal pains diagnosed as diverticulosis _ _
_ _ his heart condition rapidly worsened and surgery was recommended so johnson flew to houston to consult with heart specialist dr michael debakey where he learned his condition was terminal _ _
_ _ debakey found johnsons heart to be in such poor condition that although two of his coronary arteries required bypass surgery the former president was not well enough to consider an attempt and would likely have died in surgery _ _
_ _ johnson recorded an hourlong television interview with newsman walter cronkite at his ranch on january 12 1973 in which he discussed his legacy particularly about the civil rights movement _ _
_ _ he was still smoking heavily at the time and told cronkite that it was better for his heart to smoke than to be nervous _ _
_ _ ten days later at approximately 339 pm central time on january 22 1973 johnson suffered a massive heart attack in his bedroom _ _
_ _ he managed to telephone the secret service agents on the ranch who found him still holding the telephone receiver unconscious and not breathing _ _
_ _ johnson was airlifted in one of his planes to san antonio and taken to brooke army medical center where cardiologist and army colonel dr george mcgranahan pronounced him dead on arrival _ _
_ _ he was 64 years old _ _
_ _ the news of johnsons death was dramatically communicated on cbs evening news by walter cronkite on live television as he spoke with tom johnson lyndon b johnsons press secretary _ _
_ _ after lying in state in the rotunda of the us capitol johnson was honored with a state funeral in which texas congressman j j pickle and former secretary of state dean rusk eulogized him at the capitol _ _
_ _ the final services took place on january 25 _ _
_ _ the funeral was held at the national city christian church in washington dc where he had often worshiped as president _ _
_ _ the service was presided over by president richard nixon and attended by foreign dignitaries led by eisaku satō who had served as japanese prime minister during johnsons presidency _ _
_ _ eulogies were given by the rev _ _
_ _ dr george davis the churchs pastor and w marvin watson former postmaster general _ _
_ _ nixon did not speak though he attended as is customary for presidents during state funerals but the eulogists turned to him and lauded him for his tributes as rusk did the day before as nixon mentioned johnsons death in a speech he gave the day after johnson died announcing the peace agreement to end the vietnam war _ _
_ _ johnson was buried in his familys private cemetery a few yards from the house in which he was born _ _
_ _ eulogies were given by former texas governor connally and the reverend billy graham the minister who officiated at the burial rites _ _
_ _ the state funeral the last for a president until richard nixons in 1994 was part of an unexpectedly busy week in washington as the military district of washington mdw dealt with its second major task in less than a week beginning with richard nixons second inauguration which followed nixons landslide victory in the 1972 election _ _
_ _ the inauguration affected the state funeral in various ways because johnson died only two days after the inauguration _ _
_ _ the mdw and the armed forces inaugural committee canceled the remainder of the ceremonies surrounding the inauguration to allow for a full state funeral and many of the military men who participated in the inauguration took part in the funeral _ _
_ _ it also meant that johnsons casket traveled the entire length of the capitol entering through the senate wing when taken into the rotunda to lie in state and exiting through the house wing steps due to inauguration construction on the east front steps _ _
_ _ according to biographer randall woods johnson posed in many different roles _ _
_ _ depending on the circumstances he could be _ _
_ _ johnson the son of the tenant farmer johnson the great compromiser johnson the allknowing johnson the humble johnson the warrior johnson the dove johnson the romantic johnson the hardheaded pragmatist johnson the preserver of traditions johnson the crusader for social justice johnson the magnanimous johnson the vindictive or johnson the uncouth lbj the hick lyndon the satyr and johnson the usurper _ _
_ _ other historians have noted how he played additional roles as kent germany reports _ _
_ _ the big daddy the southernerwesternertexan the american dreamer the politician the fathers son the rising star the flawed giant the periclean paradox domestic dreams undone by war the very human the tragedy the pathbreaker the ascender and the master _ _
_ _ johnson was often seen as a wildly ambitious tireless and imposing figure who was ruthlessly effective at getting legislation passed _ _
_ _ he worked 18 to 20hour days without break and was absent of any leisure activities _ _
_ _ there was no more powerful majority leader in american history biographer robert dallek writes _ _
_ _ dallek stated that johnson had biographies on all the senators knew what their ambitions hopes and tastes were and used it to his advantage in securing votes _ _
_ _ another johnson biographer noted he could get up every day and learn what their fears their desires their wishes their wants were and he could then manipulate dominate persuade and cajole them _ _
_ _ as president johnson vetoed 30 bills no other president in history vetoed so many bills and never had a single one overridden by congress _ _
