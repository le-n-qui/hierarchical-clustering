_ _ the state legislature sent the bill to reagans desk where after many days of indecision he reluctantly signed it on june 14 1967 _ _
_ _ about two million abortions would be performed as a result mostly because of a provision in the bill allowing abortions for the wellbeing of the mother _ _
_ _ reagan had been in office for only four months when he signed the bill and later stated that had he been more experienced as governor he would not have signed it _ _
_ _ after he recognized what he called the consequences of the bill he announced that he was antiabortion _ _
_ _ he maintained that position later in his political career writing extensively about abortion _ _
_ _ in 1967 reagan signed the mulford act which repealed a law allowing the public carrying of loaded firearms becoming california penal code 12031 and 171c _ _

_ _ he chose not to seek a third term in the following election cycle _ _
_ _ one of reagans greatest frustrations in office was the controversy involving capital punishment a practice that he strongly supported _ _

_ _ reagans 1976 campaign relied on a strategy crafted by campaign manager john sears to win several primaries early to lessen the possibility of gerald fords likely nomination _ _
_ _ reagan won north carolina texas and california but the strategy failed as he lost new hampshire florida and his native illinois _ _
_ _ the texas campaign lent renewed hope to reagan when he swept all 96 delegates in the may 1 primary with four more awaiting at the state convention _ _
_ _ much of the credit for that victory came from the work of three cochairmen including ernest angelo the mayor of midland and ray barnhart of houston whom reagan as president would appoint in 1981 as director of the federal highway administration _ _
_ _ however as the republican national convention neared ford appeared close to victory _ _

_ _ early opposition was led by lgbt activists and a few progressive politicians but to many peoples surprise reagan moved to publicly oppose the measure _ _
_ _ he issued an informal letter of opposition to the initiative told reporters that he was opposed and wrote an editorial in the los angeles heraldexaminer opposing it _ _
_ _ the timing of reagans opposition was significant and surprised many because he was then preparing to run for president a race in which he would need the support of conservatives and those moderates who were uncomfortable with homosexual teachers _ _

_ _ as reagan biographer lou cannon wrote reagan was well aware that there were those who wanted him to duck the issue but nevertheless chose to state his convictions _ _
_ _ cannon reports that reagan was repelled by the aggressive public crusades against homosexual life styles which became a staple of right wing politics in the late 1970s _ _
_ _ reagans november 1 editorial stated in part whatever else it is homosexuality is not a contagious disease like the measles _ _
_ _ prevailing scientific opinion is that an individuals sexuality is determined at a very early age and that a childs teachers do not really influence this _ _
_ _ the 1980 presidential election pitted reagan against incumbent president jimmy carter and was conducted amid a multitude of domestic concerns as well as the ongoing iran hostage crisis _ _
_ _ reagans campaign stressed some of his fundamental principles lower taxes to stimulate the economy less government interference in peoples lives states rights and a strong national defense _ _
_ _ reagan launched his campaign with an indictment of a federal government that he believed had overspent overstimulated and overregulated _ _
_ _ after receiving the republican nomination reagan selected one of his opponents from the primaries george h w bush as his running mate _ _
_ _ reagans relaxed and confident appearance during the televised debate on october 28 boosted his popularity and helped to widen his lead in the polls _ _

_ _ in his inaugural address he addressed the countrys economic malaise arguing in this present crisis government is not the solution to our problems government is the problem _ _
_ _ reagan campaigned vigorously to restore organized prayer to the schools first as a moment of prayer and later as a moment of silence _ _
_ _ in 1981 reagan became the first president to propose a constitutional amendment on school prayer _ _
_ _ reagans election reflected an opposition to the 1962 supreme court case engel v vitale that had prohibited state officials from composing an official state prayer and requiring that it be recited in the public schools _ _
_ _ reagans 1981 proposed amendment stated nothing in this constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other public institutions _ _
_ _ no person shall be required by the united states or by any state to participate in prayer _ _
_ _ in 1984 reagan again raised the issue asking congress why cant  freedom to acknowledge god be enjoyed again by children in every schoolroom across this land _ _
_ _ in 1985 reagan expressed his disappointment that the supreme court ruling still banned a moment of silence for public schools and said that efforts to reinstitute prayer in public schools were an uphill battle _ _
_ _ in 1987 reagan renewed his call for congress to support voluntary prayer in schools and end the expulsion of god from americas classrooms _ _

_ _ they did not return and on august 5 reagan fired 11345 striking air traffic controllers who had ignored his order and used supervisors and military controllers to handle the nations commercial air traffic until new controllers could be hired and trained _ _
_ _ a leading reference work on public administration concluded the firing of patco employees not only demonstrated a clear resolve by the president to take control of the bureaucracy but it also sent a clear message to the private sector that unions no longer needed to be feared _ _
_ _ reagan implemented neoliberal policies based on supplyside economics advocating a laissezfaire philosophy and seeking to stimulate the economy with large acrosstheboard tax cuts _ _
_ _ he also supported returning the united states to some sort of gold standard and successfully urged congress to establish the us gold commission to study how one could be implemented _ _
_ _ citing the economic theories of arthur laffer reagan promoted the proposed tax cuts as potentially stimulating the economy enough to expand the tax base offsetting the revenue loss due to reduced rates of taxation a theory that entered political discussion as the laffer curve _ _
_ _ reaganomics was the subject of debate with supporters pointing to improvements in certain key economic indicators as evidence of success and critics pointing to large increases in federal budget deficits and the national debt _ _
_ _ his policy of peace through strength resulted in a record peacetime defense buildup including a 40 real increase in defense spending between 1981 and 1985 _ _
_ _ during reagans presidency federal income tax rates were lowered significantly with the signing of the economic recovery tax act of 1981 which lowered the top marginal tax bracket from 70 to 50 over three years as part of a 5–10–10 plan and the lowest bracket from 14 to 11 _ _
_ _ other tax increases passed by congress and signed by reagan ensured however that tax revenues over his two terms were 182 of gdp _ _
_ _ as compared to 181 over the forty years of 1970–2010 _ _
_ _ the 1981 tax act also required that exemptions and brackets be indexed for inflation starting in 1985 _ _
_ _ conversely congress passed and reagan signed into law tax increases of some nature in every year from 1981 to 1987 to continue funding such government programs as tax equity and fiscal responsibility act of 1982 tefra _ _

_ _ sixteen million new jobs were created while inflation significantly decreased _ _
_ _ the tax reform act of 1986 another bipartisan effort championed by reagan simplified the tax code by reducing the number of tax brackets to four and slashing several tax breaks _ _
_ _ the top rate was dropped to 28 but capital gains taxes were increased on those with the highest incomes from 20 to 28 _ _
_ _ the increase of the lowest tax bracket from 11 to 15 was more than offset by the expansion of personal exemption standard deduction and earned income tax credit _ _
_ _ the net result was the removal of six million poor americans from the income tax roll and a reduction of income tax liability at all income levels _ _
_ _ the net effect of all reaganera tax bills was a 1 decrease in government revenues when compared to treasury department revenue estimates from the administrations first postenactment january budgets _ _
_ _ however federal income tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989 rising from 3087 billion to 549 billion or an average annual rate of 82 25 attributed to higher social security receipts and federal outlays grew at an annual rate of 71 _ _
_ _ reagans policies proposed that economic growth would occur when marginal tax rates were low enough to spur investment which would then lead to higher employment and wages _ _
_ _ critics labeled this trickledown economics—the belief that tax policies that benefit the wealthy will create a trickledown effect reaching the poor _ _
_ _ questions arose whether reagans policies benefited the wealthy more than those living in poverty and many poor and minority citizens viewed reagan as indifferent to their struggles _ _
_ _ these views were exacerbated by the fact that reagans economic regimen included freezing the minimum wage at 335 an hour slashing federal assistance to local governments by 60 cutting the budget for public housing and section 8 rent subsidies in half and eliminating the antipoverty community development block grant program _ _
_ _ along with reagans 1981 cut in the top regular tax rate on unearned income he reduced the maximum capital gains rate to 20 _ _
_ _ reagan later set tax rates on capital gains at the same level as the rates on ordinary income like salaries and wages with both topping out at 28 _ _
_ _ reagan is viewed as an antitax hero despite raising taxes eleven times throughout his presidency all in the name of fiscal responsibility _ _
_ _ according to paul krugman over all the 1982 tax increase undid about a third of the 1981 cut as a share of gdp the increase was substantially larger than mr clintons 1993 tax increase _ _
_ _ according to historian and domestic policy advisor bruce bartlett reagans tax increases throughout his presidency took back half of the 1981 tax cut _ _
_ _ reagan was opposed to government intervention and he cut the budgets of nonmilitary programs including medicaid food stamps federal education programs and the epa _ _
_ _ he protected entitlement programs such as social security and medicare but his administration attempted to purge many people with disabilities from the social security disability rolls _ _
_ _ the administrations stance toward the savings and loan industry contributed to the savings and loan crisis _ _
_ _ a minority of the critics of reaganomics also suggested that the policies partially influenced the stock market crash of 1987 but there is no consensus regarding a single source for the crash _ _
_ _ to cover newly spawned federal budget deficits the united states borrowed heavily both domestically and abroad causing the national debt to nearly triple from 997 billion to 285 trillion _ _
_ _ reagan described the new debt as the greatest disappointment of his presidency _ _
_ _ he reappointed paul volcker as chairman of the federal reserve and in 1987 he appointed monetarist alan greenspan to succeed him _ _
_ _ reagan ended the price controls on domestic oil that had contributed to the energy crises of 1973–1974 and the summer of 1979 _ _
_ _ the price of oil subsequently dropped and there were no fuel shortages like those in the 1970s _ _
_ _ reagan also fulfilled a 1980 campaign promise to repeal the windfall profits tax in 1988 which had previously increased dependence on foreign oil _ _
_ _ some economists such as nobel prize winners milton friedman and robert mundell argue that reagans tax policies invigorated americas economy and contributed to the economic boom of the 1990s _ _
_ _ other economists such as nobel prize winner robert solow argue that reagans deficits were a major reason his successor george h w bush reneged on his campaign promise and resorted to raising taxes _ _
_ _ during reagans presidency a program was initiated within the united states intelligence community to ensure americas economic strength _ _
_ _ the program project socrates developed and demonstrated the means required for the united states to generate and lead the next evolutionary leap in technology acquisition and utilization for a competitive advantage—automated innovation _ _
_ _ to ensure that the united states acquired the maximum benefit from automated innovation reagan during his second term had an executive order drafted to create a new federal agency to implement the project socrates results on a nationwide basis _ _
_ _ however reagans term came to an end before the executive order could be coordinated and signed and the incoming bush administration labeling project socrates as industrial policy had it terminated _ _
_ _ the reagan administration was often criticized for inadequately enforcing if not actively undermining civil rights legislation _ _
_ _ in 1982 he signed a bill extending the voting rights act for 25 years after a grassroots lobbying and legislative campaign forced him to abandon his plan to ease that laws restrictions _ _
_ _ he also signed legislation establishing a federal martin luther king holiday though he did so with reservations _ _
_ _ in march 1988 he vetoed the civil rights restoration act of 1987 but his veto was overridden by congress _ _
_ _ reagan had argued that the legislation infringed on states rights and the rights of churches and business owners _ _
_ _ reagan escalated the cold war accelerating a reversal from the policy of détente that began during the carter administration following the afghan saur revolution and subsequent soviet invasion _ _
_ _ he ordered a massive buildup of the united states armed forces and implemented new policies that were directed towards the soviet union he revived the b1 lancer program that had been canceled by the carter administration and he produced the mx missile _ _
_ _ in response to soviet deployment of the ss20 reagan oversaw natos deployment of the pershing missile in west germany _ _
_ _ in 1982 reagan tried to cut off moscows access to hard currency by impeding its proposed gas line to western europe _ _
_ _ it hurt the soviet economy but it also caused ill will among american allies in europe who counted on that revenue _ _
_ _ reagan retreated on this issue _ _
_ _ in 1984 journalist nicholas lemann interviewed secretary of defense caspar weinberger and summarized the strategy of the reagan administration to roll back the soviet union _ _
_ _ their society is economically weak and it lacks the wealth education and technology to enter the information age _ _
_ _ they have thrown everything into military production and their society is starting to show terrible stress as a result _ _
_ _ they cant sustain military production the way we can _ _
_ _ eventually it will break them and then there will be just one superpower in a safe world—if only if we can keep spending _ _
_ _ lemann noted that when he wrote that in 1984 he thought the reaganites were living in a fantasy world _ _
_ _ but by 2016 lemann stated that the passage represents a fairly uncontroversial description of what reagan actually did _ _
_ _ reagan and the united kingdoms prime minister margaret thatcher both denounced the soviet union in ideological terms _ _
_ _ in a famous address on june 8 1982 to the parliament of the united kingdom in the royal gallery of the palace of westminster reagan said the march of freedom and democracy will leave marxism–leninism on the ash heap of history _ _
_ _ on march 3 1983 he predicted that communism would collapse stating communism is another sad bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written _ _

_ _ the reagan administration responded to the incident by suspending all soviet passenger air service to the united states and dropped several agreements being negotiated with the soviets wounding them financially _ _
_ _ as a result of the shootdown and the cause of kal 007s going astray thought to be inadequacies related to its navigational system reagan announced on september 16 1983 that the global positioning system would be made available for civilian use free of charge once completed in order to avert similar navigational errors in the future _ _
_ _ under a policy that came to be known as the reagan doctrine reagan and his administration also provided overt and covert aid to anticommunist resistance movements in an effort to rollback sovietbacked communist governments in africa asia and latin america _ _
_ _ however in a break from the carter administrations policy of arming taiwan under the taiwan relations act reagan also agreed with the communist government in china to reduce the sale of arms to taiwan _ _
_ _ reagan deployed the cias special activities division to afghanistan and pakistan _ _
_ _ they were instrumental in training equipping and leading mujahideen forces against the soviet army _ _
_ _ president reagans covert action program has been given credit for assisting in ending the soviet occupation of afghanistan though some of the united states funded armaments introduced then would later pose a threat to us troops in the 2001 war in afghanistan _ _
_ _ the cia also began sharing information with the iranian government which it was secretly courting _ _
_ _ in one instance in 1982 this practice enabled the government to identify and purge communists from its ministries and to virtually eliminate the prosoviet infrastructure in iran _ _
_ _ in march 1983 reagan introduced the strategic defense initiative sdi a defense project that would have used ground and spacebased systems to protect the united states from attack by strategic nuclear ballistic missiles _ _
_ _ reagan believed that this defense shield could make nuclear war impossible _ _
_ _ there was much disbelief surrounding the programs scientific feasibility leading opponents to dub sdi star wars and argue that its technological objective was unattainable _ _
_ _ the soviets became concerned about the possible effects sdi would have leader yuri andropov said it would put the entire world in jeopardy _ _
_ _ for those reasons david gergen a former aide to president reagan believes that in retrospect sdi hastened the end of the cold war _ _
_ _ though supported by leading american conservatives who argued that reagans foreign policy strategy was essential to protecting us security interests critics labeled the administrations foreign policy initiatives as aggressive and imperialistic and chided them as warmongering _ _
_ _ the administration was also heavily criticized for backing anticommunist leaders accused of severe human rights violations such as hissène habré of chad and efraín ríos montt of guatemala _ _
_ _ during the 16 months 1982–1983 montt was president of guatemala the guatemalan military was accused of genocide for massacres of members of the ixil people and other indigenous groups _ _
_ _ reagan had said that montt was getting a bum rap and described him as a man of great personal integrity _ _
_ _ previous human rights violations had prompted the united states to cut off aid to the guatemalan government but the reagan administration appealed to congress to restart military aid _ _
_ _ although unsuccessful with that the administration was successful in providing nonmilitary assistance such as usaid _ _
_ _ with the approval of congress reagan sent forces to lebanon in 1983 to reduce the threat of the lebanese civil war _ _

_ _ on october 25 1983 reagan ordered us forces to invade grenada codenamed operation urgent fury where a 1979 coup détat had established a sovietcuban supported marxist–leninist government led by maurice bishop _ _
_ _ a week before the invasion bishop was overthrown and executed following a coup détat by bernard coard _ _
_ _ a formal appeal from the organisation of eastern caribbean states oecs led to the intervention of us forces president reagan also cited a regional threat posed by a sovietcuban military buildup in the caribbean nation and concern for the safety of several hundred american medical students at st georges university as adequate reasons to invade _ _
_ _ operation urgent fury was the first major military operation conducted by us forces since the vietnam war _ _
_ _ several days of fighting commenced resulting in a us victory with 19 american fatalities and 116 wounded american soldiers _ _

_ _ he proclaimed that it was morning again in america regarding the recovering economy and the dominating performance by the american athletes at the 1984 summer olympics on home soil among other things _ _
_ _ he became the first us president to open an olympic games _ _
_ _ previous olympics taking place in the united states had been opened by either the vice president three times or another person in charge twice _ _
_ _ reagans opponent in the 1984 presidential election was former vice president walter mondale _ _
_ _ following a weak performance in the first presidential debate reagans ability to win another term was questioned _ _
_ _ reagan rebounded in the second debate confronting questions about his age he quipped i will not make age an issue of this campaign _ _
_ _ i am not going to exploit for political purposes my opponents youth and inexperience _ _
_ _ this remark generated applause and laughter even from mondale himself _ _
_ _ that november reagan won a landslide reelection victory carrying 49 of the 50 states _ _
_ _ mondale won only his home state of minnesota and the district of columbia _ _
_ _ reagan won 525 of the 538 electoral votes the most of any presidential candidate in us _ _
_ _ history _ _

_ _ reagan won 588 of the popular vote to mondales 406 _ _
_ _ his popular vote margin of victory—nearly 169 million votes 544 million for reagan to 375 million for mondale—was exceeded only by richard nixon in his 1972 victory over george mcgovern _ _
_ _ reagan was sworn in as president for the second time on january 20 1985 in a private ceremony at the white house _ _
_ _ at the time the 73yearold reagan was the oldest person to take the presidential oath of office this record was later surpassed by joe biden who was 78 at his inauguration in 2021 _ _
_ _ because january 20 fell on a sunday a public celebration was not held but took place in the capitol rotunda the following day _ _
_ _ january 21 was one of the coldest days on record in washington dc due to poor weather inaugural celebrations were held inside the capitol _ _
_ _ in the weeks that followed reagan shook up his staff somewhat moving white house chief of staff james baker to secretary of the treasury and naming treasury secretary donald regan a former merrill lynch officer chief of staff _ _
_ _ in response to concerns about the increasing crack epidemic reagan began the war on drugs campaign in 1982 a policy led by the federal government to reduce the illegal drug trade _ _

_ _ he said that drugs were menacing our society and promised to fight for drugfree schools and workplaces expanded drug treatment stronger law enforcement and drug interdiction efforts and greater public awareness _ _
_ _ in 1986 reagan signed a drug enforcement bill that budgeted 17 billion equivalent to 42 billion in 2021 to fund the war on drugs and specified a mandatory minimum penalty for drug offenses _ _
_ _ the bill was criticized for promoting significant racial disparities in the prison population and critics also charged that the policies did little to reduce the availability of drugs on the street while resulting in a tremendous financial burden for america _ _
_ _ defenders of the effort point to success in reducing rates of adolescent drug use which they attribute to the reagan administrations policies marijuana use among highschool seniors declined from 33 in 1980 to 12 in 1991 _ _

_ _ according to aids _ _
_ _ activist organizations such as act up and scholars such as don francis and peter s arno the reagan administration largely ignored the aids _ _
_ _ crisis which began to unfold in the united states in 1981 the same year reagan took office _ _
_ _ they also claim that aids _ _
_ _ research was chronically underfunded during reagans administration and requests for more funding by doctors at the centers for disease control cdc _ _
_ _ were routinely denied _ _

_ _ in a september 1985 press conference reagan answering a related question said this is a top priority with us yes theres no question about the seriousness of this and the need to find an answer _ _
_ _ gary bauer reagans domestic policy advisor near the end of his second term argued that reagans belief in cabinet government led him to assign the job of speaking out against aids _ _
_ _ to his surgeon general of the united states and the united states secretary of health and human services _ _
_ _ from the late 1960s onward the american public grew increasingly vocal in its opposition to the apartheid policy of the whiteminority government of south africa and in its insistence that the us impose economic and diplomatic sanctions on south africa _ _
_ _ the strength of the antiapartheid opposition surged during reagans first term in office as its component disinvestment from south africa movement which had been in existence for quite some years gained critical mass following in the united states particularly on college campuses and among mainline protestant denominations _ _
_ _ president reagan was opposed to divestiture because as he wrote in a letter to sammy davis jr it would hurt the very people we are trying to help and would leave us no contact within south africa to try and bring influence to bear on the government _ _
_ _ he also noted the fact that the americanowned industries there employ more than 80000 blacks and that their employment practices were very different from the normal south african customs _ _
_ _ as an alternative strategy for opposing apartheid the reagan administration developed a policy of constructive engagement with the south african government as a means of encouraging it to move away from apartheid gradually _ _
_ _ it was part of a larger initiative designed to foster peaceful economic development and political change throughout southern africa _ _
_ _ this policy however engendered much public criticism and renewed calls for the imposition of stringent sanctions _ _
_ _ in response reagan announced the imposition of new sanctions on the south african government including an arms embargo in late 1985 _ _
_ _ these sanctions were however seen as weak by antiapartheid activists and as insufficient by the presidents opponents in congress _ _
_ _ in august 1986 congress approved the comprehensive antiapartheid act which included tougher sanctions _ _
_ _ reagan vetoed the act but the veto was overridden by congress _ _
_ _ afterward reagan reiterated that his administration and all america opposed apartheid and said the debate  was not whether or not to oppose apartheid but instead how best to oppose it and how best to bring freedom to that troubled country _ _
_ _ several european countries as well as japan also imposed their sanctions on south africa soon after _ _
_ _ relations between libya and the united states under president reagan were continually contentious beginning with the gulf of sidra incident in 1981 by 1982 libyan leader muammar gaddafi was considered by the cia to be along with ussr leader leonid brezhnev and cuban leader fidel castro part of a group known as the unholy trinity and was also labeled as our international public enemy number one by a cia official _ _
_ _ these tensions were later revived in early april 1986 when a bomb exploded in a berlin discothèque resulting in the injury of 63 american military personnel and death of one serviceman _ _
_ _ stating that there was irrefutable proof that libya had directed the terrorist bombing reagan authorized the use of force against the country _ _
_ _ in the late evening of april 15 1986 the united states launched a series of airstrikes on ground targets in libya _ _
_ _ british prime minister margaret thatcher allowed the us air force to use britains air bases to launch the attack on the justification that the uk was supporting americas right to selfdefense under article 51 of the united nations charter _ _
_ _ the attack was according to reagan designed to halt gaddafis ability to export terrorism offering him incentives and reasons to alter his criminal behavior _ _
_ _ the president addressed the nation from the oval office after the attacks had commenced stating when our citizens are attacked or abused anywhere in the world on the direct orders of hostile regimes we will respond so long as im in this office _ _
_ _ the attack was condemned by many countries _ _
_ _ by a vote of 79 in favor to 28 against with 33 abstentions the united nations general assembly adopted resolution 4138 which condemns the military attack perpetrated against the socialist peoples libyan arab jamahiriya on april 15 1986 which constitutes a violation of the charter of the united nations and of international law _ _
_ _ reagan signed the immigration reform and control act in 1986 _ _
_ _ the act made it illegal to knowingly hire or recruit illegal immigrants required employers to attest to their employees immigration status and granted amnesty to approximately three million illegal immigrants who entered the united states before january 1 1982 and had lived in the country continuously _ _
_ _ upon signing the act at a ceremony held beside the newly refurbished statue of liberty reagan said the legalization provisions in this act will go far to improve the lives of a class of individuals who now must hide in the shadows without access to many of the benefits of a free and open society _ _
_ _ very soon many of these men and women will be able to step into the sunlight and ultimately if they choose they may become americans _ _
_ _ reagan also said the employer sanctions program is the keystone and major element _ _
_ _ it will remove the incentive for illegal immigration by eliminating the job opportunities which draw illegal aliens here _ _
_ _ the iran–contra affair became a political scandal in the united states during the 1980s _ _
_ _ the scandal stemmed from the use of proceeds from covert arms sales to iran during the iran–iraq war to fund the contra rebels fighting against the government in nicaragua funding which had been specifically outlawed by an act of congress _ _
_ _ the international court of justice whose jurisdiction to decide the case was disputed by the united states ruled that the united states had violated international law and breached treaties in nicaragua in various ways _ _
_ _ reagan later withdrew the agreement between the united states and the international court of justice _ _
_ _ president reagan professed that he was unaware of the plots existence _ _
_ _ he opened his own investigation and appointed two republicans and one democrat john tower brent scowcroft and edmund muskie respectively to investigate the scandal _ _
_ _ the commission could not find direct evidence that reagan had prior knowledge of the program but criticized him heavily for his disengagement from managing his staff making the diversion of funds possible _ _
_ _ a separate report by congress concluded that if the president did not know what his national security advisers were doing he should have _ _
_ _ reagans popularity declined from 67 to 46 in less than a week the most significant and quickest decline ever for a president _ _
_ _ the scandal resulted in eleven convictions and fourteen indictments within reagans staff _ _
_ _ many central americans criticize reagan for his support of the contras calling him an anticommunist zealot blinded to human rights abuses while others say he saved central america _ _
_ _ daniel ortega sandinistan and president of nicaragua said that he hoped god would forgive reagan for his dirty war against nicaragua _ _
_ _ in 1988 near the end of the iran–iraq war the us navy guidedmissile cruiser uss vincennes accidentally shot down iran air flight 655 killing 290 civilian passengers _ _
_ _ the incident further worsened already tense iran–united states relations _ _
_ _ until the early 1970s the united states had relied on the qualitative superiority of its weapons to offset the soviet superiority in number of weapons possessed but soviet technological advances had narrowed that advantage by the time reagan took office in 1981 _ _
_ _ although the soviet union did not accelerate military spending in response to reagans military buildup their enormous military expenses in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing were a heavy burden for the soviet economy _ _
_ _ at the same time oil prices in 1985 fell to one third of the previous level oil was the primary source of soviet export revenues _ _

_ _ when chief justice warren e burger retired in september 1986 reagan nominated incumbent associate justice william rehnquist to succeed burger as chief justice the appointment of an incumbent associate justice as chief justice is subject to a separate confirmation process _ _
_ _ then following rehnquists confirmation the president named antonin scalia to fill the consequent associate justice vacancy _ _
_ _ reagans final opportunity to fill a vacancy arose in mid1987 when associate justice lewis f powell jr announced his intention to retire _ _
_ _ reagan initially chose conservative jurist robert bork to succeed powell _ _
_ _ borks nomination was strongly opposed by civil and womens rights groups and by senate democrats _ _
_ _ that october after a contentious senate debate the nomination was rejected by a roll call vote of 42–58 _ _

_ _ in a 2011 book titled my father at 100 reagans son ron said he had suspected early signs of his fathers dementia as early as 1984 an allegation that sparked a furious response from his brother michael reagan who accused him of selling out his father to sell books _ _
_ _ ron would later temper his claims telling the new york times he did not believe his father was actually inhibited by alzheimers while in office only that the disease was likely present in him for years prior to his 1994 diagnoses _ _

_ _ stahl wrote that she came close to reporting that reagan was senile but by the end of the meeting he had regained his alertness _ _
_ _ lay observations that reagan suffered from alzheimers while still in office have been widely refuted by medical experts however including the many physicians who treated reagan both during and after his presidency _ _
_ _ regarding his mental competency while in office all four of reagans white house doctors maintained they never had any concerns even with the hindsight of the former presidents diagnosis _ _
_ _ neurosurgeon daniel ruge who served as physician to the president from 1981 to 1985 said that he never detected signs of the disease while speaking almost every day with reagan _ _
_ _ john e hutton who served from 1985 to 1989 said the president absolutely did not show any signs of dementia or alzheimers _ _
_ _ though all were familiar with the disease none of reagans white house physicians was an expert in alzheimers specifically an outside specialist who reviewed both reagans public and medical records agreed with the conclusion that he displayed no signs of dementia during his presidency _ _

_ _ however mark weisbrot codirector of the center for economic and policy research contended that reagans economic policies were mostly a failure while howard kurtz of the washington post opined that reagan was a far more controversial figure in his time than the largely gushing obits on television would suggest _ _
_ _ despite the continuing debate surrounding his legacy many conservative and liberal scholars agree that reagan has been the most influential president since franklin d roosevelt leaving his imprint on american politics diplomacy culture and economics through his effective communication and pragmatic compromising _ _
_ _ as summarized by british historian m j heale since reagan left office historians have reached a broad consensus that he rehabilitated conservatism turned the nation to the right practiced a considerably pragmatic conservatism that balanced ideology and the constraints of politics revived faith in the presidency and american exceptionalism and contributed to victory in the cold war _ _

_ _ as a result this left the united states as the world’s only superpower _ _
_ _ reagans exact role in the ussr’s collapse is debated with many proponents believing that reagans defense policies economic policies military policies and hardline rhetoric against the soviet union and communism—together with his summits with general secretary gorbachev—played a significant part in ending the cold war _ _
_ _ he was the first president to reject containment and détente and to put into practice the concept that the soviet union could be defeated rather than simply negotiated with a postdétente strategy a conviction that was vindicated by gennadi gerasimov the foreign ministry spokesman under gorbachev who said that the strategic defense initiative was very successful blackmail _ _
_ _ the soviet economy couldnt endure such competition _ _
_ _ reagans aggressive rhetoric toward the ussr had mixed effects jeffery w knopf observes that being labeled evil probably made no difference to the soviets but gave encouragement to the easteuropean citizens opposed to communism _ _
_ _ general secretary gorbachev said of his former rivals cold war role he was a man who was instrumental in bringing about the end of the cold war and deemed him a great president _ _

_ _ said brian mulroney former prime minister of canada he enters history as a strong and dramatic player in the cold war _ _
_ _ former president lech wałęsa of poland acknowledged reagan was one of the world leaders who made a major contribution to communisms collapse _ _
_ _ professor jeffrey knopf has argued that reagans leadership was only one of several causes of the end of the cold war _ _
