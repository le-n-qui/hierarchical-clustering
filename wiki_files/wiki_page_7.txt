_ _ it sums up not what i intend to offer the american people but what i intend to ask of them _ _
_ _ at the start of the fall general election campaign the republican nominee and incumbent vice president richard nixon held a sixpoint lead in the polls _ _
_ _ major issues included how to get the economy moving again kennedys roman catholicism the cuban revolution and whether the space and missile programs of the soviet union had surpassed those of the us to address fears that his being catholic would impact his decisionmaking he told the greater houston ministerial association on september 12 1960 i am not the catholic candidate for president _ _
_ _ i am the democratic party candidate for president who also happens to be a catholic _ _
_ _ i do not speak for my church on public matters—and the church does not speak for me _ _
_ _ kennedy questioned rhetorically whether onequarter of americans were relegated to secondclass citizenship just because they were catholic and once stated that o one asked me my religion serving the navy in the south pacific _ _
_ _ despite kennedys efforts to quell anticatholic concerns and similar statements by highprofile protestant figures religious bigotry would dog the democratic candidate through the end of the campaign _ _
_ _ his score among white protestants would ultimately be lower than adlai stevensons in 1956 though stevenson lost his election _ _
_ _ some catholic leaders also expressed reservations about kennedy but the vast majority of laypeople rallied to him _ _
_ _ nixon attended the first of these debates after a day of campaigning whilst running a fever and having previously suffered an infected leg injury earlier in the campaign _ _
_ _ during the debate nixon looked at the reporters asking questions and not at the camera and was perspirating which his makeup accentuated _ _
_ _ he wore a tan suit which reduced his presence against the set background and his fastgrowing facial hair was visible as five oclock shadow _ _
_ _ in contrast kennedy had spent the preceding days on debate preparation appeared relaxed and looked into the camera whilst answering questions _ _
_ _ it is commonly said that kennedy appearing to be the more attractive man of the two won him the debate largely because of a poll in which voters who watched on tv thought that kennedy had won but radio listeners believed nixon to have won _ _
_ _ however only one poll split tv and radio voters like this and the methodology of the pollsters was poor failing to account for predebate political or religious biases and only interviewing 178 radio listeners who believed the debate had been won by either candidate _ _
_ _ the location of the polling is also unknown even though nixon would have been more popular predebate anyway in protestant rural areas with less access to television _ _
_ _ 1960 was a close race and there is no polling available consistent with the idea that nixon lost or kennedy gained support as a result of the debate _ _
_ _ vancil and pendell point out that nixon did not win the debate by strength of argument either democratic figures were satisfied with kennedys debate performance and even many southern democrats who had been apathetic or hostile towards kennedy were impressed but nixons performance alarmed republican figures who thought that his defensiveness and metooism repeatedly emphasising his agreement with kennedy realised their worst fears and was a surprisingly poor performance from him _ _
_ _ the debates are now considered a milestone in american political history—the point at which the medium of television began to play a dominant role in politics _ _
_ _ kennedys campaign gained momentum after the first debate and he pulled slightly ahead of nixon in most polls _ _
_ _ on election day kennedy defeated nixon in one of the closest presidential elections of the 20th century _ _
_ _ in the national popular vote by most accounts kennedy led nixon by just twotenths of one percent 497 to 495 while in the electoral college he won 303 votes to nixons 219 269 were needed to win _ _
_ _ fourteen electors from mississippi and alabama refused to support kennedy because of his support for the civil rights movement they voted for senator harry f byrd of virginia as did an elector from oklahoma _ _
_ _ fortythree years old kennedy was the youngest person ever elected to the presidency though theodore roosevelt was a year younger when as vicepresident he succeeded to the presidency after the assassination of william mckinley in 1901 _ _
_ _ john f kennedy was sworn in as the 35th president at noon on january 20 1961 _ _
_ _ in his inaugural address he spoke of the need for all americans to be active citizens ask not what your country can do for you—ask what you can do for your country _ _
_ _ he asked the nations of the world to join to fight what he called the common enemies of man tyranny poverty disease and war itself _ _
_ _ he added _ _
_ _ all this will not be finished in the first one hundred days _ _
_ _ nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days nor in the life of this administration nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet _ _
_ _ but let us begin _ _
_ _ in closing he expanded on his desire for greater internationalism finally whether you are citizens of america or citizens of the world ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you _ _
_ _ the address reflected kennedys confidence that his administration would chart a historically significant course in both domestic policy and foreign affairs _ _
_ _ the contrast between this optimistic vision and the pressures of managing daily political realities at home and abroad would be one of the main tensions running through the early years of his administration _ _
_ _ kennedy brought to the white house a contrast in organization compared to the decisionmaking structure of former general eisenhower and he wasted no time in scrapping eisenhowers methods _ _
_ _ kennedy preferred the organizational structure of a wheel with all the spokes leading to the president _ _
_ _ he was ready and willing to make the increased number of quick decisions required in such an environment _ _
_ _ he selected a mixture of experienced and inexperienced people to serve in his cabinet _ _
_ _ we can learn our jobs together he stated _ _
_ _ much to the chagrin of his economic advisors who wanted him to reduce taxes kennedy quickly agreed to a balanced budget pledge _ _
_ _ this was needed in exchange for votes to expand the membership of the house rules committee in order to give the democrats a majority in setting the legislative agenda _ _
_ _ kennedy focused on immediate and specific issues facing the administration and quickly voiced his impatience with pondering deeper meanings _ _
_ _ deputy national security advisor walt whitman rostow once began a diatribe about the growth of communism and kennedy abruptly cut him off asking what do you want me to do about that today _ _
_ _ kennedy approved defense secretary robert mcnamaras controversial decision to award the contract for the f111 tfx tactical fighter experimental fighterbomber to general dynamics the choice of the civilian defense department over boeing the choice of the military _ _
_ _ at the request of senator henry jackson senator john mcclellan held 46 days of mostly closeddoor hearings before the permanent subcommittee on investigations investigating the tfx contract from february to november 1963 _ _
_ _ during the summer of 1962 kennedy had a secret taping system set up in the white house most likely to aid his future memoir _ _
_ _ it recorded many conversations with kennedy and his cabinet members including those in relation to the cuban missile crisis _ _
_ _ kennedys foreign policy was dominated by american confrontations with the soviet union manifested by proxy contests in the early stage of the cold war _ _
_ _ in 1961 he anxiously anticipated a summit with soviet premier nikita khrushchev _ _
_ _ he started off on the wrong foot by reacting aggressively to a routine khrushchev speech on cold war confrontation in early 1961 _ _
_ _ the speech was intended for domestic audiences in the soviet union but kennedy interpreted it as a personal challenge _ _
_ _ his mistake helped raise tensions going into the vienna summit of june 1961 _ _
_ _ on the way to the summit kennedy stopped in paris to meet french president charles de gaulle who advised him to ignore khrushchevs abrasive style _ _
_ _ the french president feared the united states presumed influence in europe _ _
_ _ nevertheless de gaulle was quite impressed with the young president and his family _ _
_ _ kennedy picked up on this in his speech in paris saying that he would be remembered as the man who accompanied jackie kennedy to paris _ _
_ _ on june 4 1961 kennedy met with khrushchev in vienna and left the meetings angry and disappointed that he had allowed the premier to bully him despite the warnings he had received _ _
_ _ khrushchev for his part was impressed with the presidents intelligence but thought him weak _ _
_ _ kennedy did succeed in conveying the bottom line to khrushchev on the most sensitive issue before them a proposed treaty between moscow and east berlin _ _
_ _ he made it clear that any treaty interfering with us access rights in west berlin would be regarded as an act of war _ _
_ _ shortly after kennedy returned home the ussr announced its plan to sign a treaty with east berlin abrogating any thirdparty occupation rights in either sector of the city _ _
_ _ depressed and angry kennedy assumed that his only option was to prepare the country for nuclear war which he personally thought had a oneinfive chance of occurring _ _
_ _ in the weeks immediately following the vienna summit more than 20000 people fled from east berlin to the western sector reacting to statements from the ussr kennedy began intensive meetings on the berlin issue where dean acheson took the lead in recommending a military buildup alongside nato allies _ _
_ _ in a july 1961 speech kennedy announced his decision to add 325 billion equivalent to 2947 billion in 2021 to the defense budget along with over 200000 additional troops stating that an attack on west berlin would be taken as an attack on the us _ _
_ _ the speech received an 85 approval rating _ _
_ _ a month later both the soviet union and east berlin began blocking any further passage of east germans into west berlin and erected barbed wire fences which were quickly upgraded to the berlin wall around the city _ _
_ _ kennedys initial reaction was to ignore this as long as free access from the west to west berlin continued _ _
_ _ this course was altered when west berliners had lost confidence in the defense of their position by the united states _ _
_ _ kennedy sent vice president johnson and lucius d clay along with a host of military personnel in convoy through east germany including sovietarmed checkpoints to demonstrate the continued commitment of the us to west berlin _ _
_ _ kennedy gave a speech at saint anselm college on may 5 1960 regarding americas conduct in the emerging cold war _ _
_ _ his address detailed how he felt american foreign policy should be conducted towards african nations noting a hint of support for modern african nationalism by saying for we too founded a new nation on revolt from colonial rule _ _
_ _ the eisenhower administration had created a plan to overthrow fidel castros regime in cuba _ _
_ _ led by the central intelligence agency cia with help from the us military the plan was for an invasion of cuba by a counterrevolutionary insurgency composed of ustrained anticastro cuban exiles led by cia paramilitary officers _ _
_ _ the intention was to invade cuba and instigate an uprising among the cuban people hoping to remove castro from power _ _
_ _ kennedy approved the final invasion plan on april 4 1961 _ _
_ _ the bay of pigs invasion began on april 17 1961 _ _
_ _ fifteen hundred ustrained cubans dubbed brigade 2506 landed on the island _ _
_ _ no us air support was provided _ _
_ _ cia director allen dulles later stated that they thought kennedy would authorize any action that was needed for success once the troops were on the ground _ _
_ _ by april 19 1961 the cuban government had captured or killed the invading exiles and kennedy was forced to negotiate for the release of the 1189 survivors _ _
_ _ twenty months later cuba released the captured exiles in exchange for 53 million worth of food and medicine _ _
_ _ the incident made castro feel wary of the us and led him to believe that another invasion would take place _ _
_ _ biographer richard reeves said that kennedy focused primarily on the political repercussions of the plan rather than military considerations _ _
_ _ when it proved unsuccessful he was convinced that the plan was a setup to make him look bad _ _
_ _ he took responsibility for the failure saying we got a big kick in the leg and we deserved it _ _
_ _ but maybe well learn something from it _ _
_ _ he appointed robert kennedy to help lead a committee to examine the causes of the failure _ _
_ _ in late1961 the white house formed the special group augmented headed by robert kennedy and including edward lansdale secretary robert mcnamara and others _ _
_ _ the groups objective—to overthrow castro via espionage sabotage and other covert tactics—was never pursued _ _
_ _ in march 1962 kennedy rejected operation northwoods proposals for false flag attacks against american military and civilian targets and blaming them on the cuban government in order to gain approval for a war against cuba _ _
_ _ however the administration continued to plan for an invasion of cuba in the summer of 1962 _ _
_ _ on october 14 1962 cia u2 spy planes took photographs of the soviets construction of intermediaterange ballistic missile sites in cuba _ _
_ _ the photos were shown to kennedy on october 16 a consensus was reached that the missiles were offensive in nature and thus posed an immediate nuclear threat _ _
_ _ kennedy faced a dilemma if the us attacked the sites it might lead to nuclear war with the ussr but if the us did nothing it would be faced with the increased threat from closerange nuclear weapons _ _
_ _ the us would also appear to the world as less committed to the defense of the hemisphere _ _
_ _ on a personal level kennedy needed to show resolve in reaction to khrushchev especially after the vienna summit _ _
_ _ more than a third of us national security council nsc members favored an unannounced air assault on the missile sites but for some of them this conjured up an image of pearl harbor in reverse _ _
_ _ there was also some concern from the international community asked in confidence that the assault plan was an overreaction in light of the fact that eisenhower had placed pgm19 jupiter missiles in italy and turkey in 1958 _ _
_ _ it also could not be assured that the assault would be 100 effective _ _
_ _ in concurrence with a majorityvote of the nsc kennedy decided on a naval quarantine _ _
_ _ on october 22 he dispatched a message to khrushchev and announced the decision on tv _ _
_ _ the us navy would stop and inspect all soviet ships arriving off cuba beginning october 24 _ _
_ _ the organization of american states gave unanimous support to the removal of the missiles _ _
_ _ kennedy exchanged two sets of letters with khrushchev to no avail _ _
_ _ united nations un secretary general u thant requested both parties to reverse their decisions and enter a coolingoff period _ _
_ _ khrushchev agreed but kennedy did not _ _
_ _ one sovietflagged ship was stopped and boarded _ _
_ _ on october 28 khrushchev agreed to dismantle the missile sites subject to un inspections _ _
_ _ the us publicly promised never to invade cuba and privately agreed to remove its jupiter missiles from italy and turkey which were by then obsolete and had been supplanted by submarines equipped with ugm27 polaris missiles _ _
_ _ this crisis brought the world closer to nuclear war than at any point before or after _ _
_ _ it is considered that the humanity of both khrushchev and kennedy prevailed _ _
_ _ the crisis improved the image of american willpower and the presidents credibility _ _
_ _ kennedys approval rating increased from 66 to 77 immediately thereafter _ _
_ _ believing that those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable kennedy sought to contain the perceived threat of communism in latin america by establishing the alliance for progress which sent aid to some countries and sought greater human rights standards in the region _ _
_ _ he worked closely with puerto rican governor luis muñoz marín for the development of the alliance of progress and began working to further puerto ricos autonomy _ _
_ _ the eisenhower administration through the cia had begun formulating plans to assassinate castro in cuba and rafael trujillo in the dominican republic _ _
_ _ when kennedy took office he privately instructed the cia that any plan must include plausible deniability by the us his public position was in opposition _ _
_ _ in june 1961 the dominican republics leader was assassinated in the days following undersecretary of state chester bowles led a cautious reaction by the nation _ _
_ _ robert kennedy who saw an opportunity for the us called bowles a gutless bastard to his face _ _
_ _ in one of his first presidential acts kennedy asked congress to create the peace corps _ _
_ _ his brotherinlaw sargent shriver was its first director _ _
_ _ through this program americans volunteered to help developing nations in fields like education farming health care and construction _ _
_ _ the organization grew to 5000 members by march 1963 and 10000 the year after _ _
_ _ since 1961 over 200000 americans have joined the peace corps representing 139 countries _ _
_ _ as a us _ _
_ _ congressman in 1951 kennedy became fascinated with vietnam after visiting the area as part of a big factfinding mission to asia and the middle east even stressing in a subsequent radio address that he strongly favored check the southern drive of communism _ _
_ _ as a us senator in 1956 kennedy publicly advocated for greater us involvement in vietnam _ _
_ _ when briefing kennedy eisenhower emphasized that the communist threat in southeast asia required priority eisenhower considered laos to be the cork in the bottle regarding the regional threat _ _
_ _ in march 1961 kennedy voiced a change in policy from supporting a free laos to a neutral laos indicating privately that vietnam and not laos should be deemed americas tripwire for communisms spread in the area _ _
_ _ in may he dispatched lyndon johnson to meet with south vietnamese president ngo dinh diem _ _
_ _ johnson assured diem more aid to mold a fighting force that could resist the communists _ _
_ _ kennedy announced a change of policy from support to partnership with diem to defeat of communism in south vietnam _ _
_ _ during his presidency kennedy continued policies that provided political economic and military support to the governments of south korea and south vietnam _ _
_ _ we have onemillion americans today serving outside the unitedstates _ _
_ _ theres no other country in history thats carried this kind of a burden _ _
_ _ other countries have had forces serving outside their own country but for conquest _ _
_ _ we have two divisions in southkorea not to control southkorea but to defend it _ _
_ _ we have a lot of americans in south vietnam _ _
_ _ well no other country in the world has ever done that since the beginning of the world greece rome napoleon and all the rest always had conquest _ _
_ _ we have a million men outside and they try to defend these countries _ _
_ _ the viet cong began assuming a predominant presence in late 1961 initially seizing the provincial capital of phuoc vinh _ _
_ _ after a mission to vietnam in october presidential adviser general maxwell d taylor and deputy national security adviser walt rostow recommended the deployment of 6000 to 8000 us combat troops to vietnam _ _
_ _ kennedy increased the number of military advisers and special forces in the area from 11000 in 1962 to 16000 by late 1963 but he was reluctant to order a fullscale deployment of troops _ _
_ _ however kennedy who was wary about the regions successful war of independence against france was also eager to not give the impression to the vietnamese people that the united states was acting as the regions new colonizer even stating in his journal at one point that the united states was more and more becoming colonists in the minds of the people _ _
_ _ a year and three months later on march 8 1965 his successor president lyndon johnson committed the first combat troops to vietnam and greatly escalated us involvement with forces reaching 184000 that year and 536000 in 1968 _ _
_ _ in late 1961 kennedy sent roger hilsman then director of the state departments bureau of intelligence and research to assess the situation in vietnam _ _
_ _ there hilsman met sir robert grainger ker thompson head of the british advisory mission to south vietnam and the strategic hamlet program was formed _ _
_ _ it was approved by kennedy and south vietnam president ngo dinh diem _ _
_ _ it was implemented in early 1962 and involved some forced relocation village internment and segregation of rural south vietnamese into new communities where the peasantry would be isolated from communist insurgents _ _
_ _ it was hoped that these new communities would provide security for the peasants and strengthen the tie between them and the central government _ _
_ _ by november 1963 the program waned and officially ended in 1964 _ _
_ _ in early 1962 kennedy formally authorized escalated involvement when he signed the national security action memorandum – subversive insurgency war of liberation _ _
_ _ operation ranch hand a largescale aerial defoliation effort began on the roadsides of south vietnam _ _
_ _ depending on which assessment kennedy accepted department of defense or state there had been zero or modest progress in countering the increase in communist aggression in return for an expanded us _ _
_ _ involvement _ _
_ _ in april 1963 kennedy assessed the situation in vietnam saying we dont have a prayer of staying in vietnam _ _
_ _ those people hate us _ _
_ _ they are going to throw our asses out of there at any point _ _
_ _ but i cant give up that territory to the communists and get the american people to reelect me _ _
_ _ on august 21 just as the new us _ _
_ _ ambassador henry cabot lodge jr arrived diem and his brother ngo dinh nhu ordered south vietnam forces funded and trained by the cia to quell buddhist demonstrations _ _
_ _ the crackdowns heightened expectations of a coup détat to remove diem with or perhaps by his brother nhu _ _
_ _ lodge was instructed to try getting diem and nhu to step down and leave the country _ _
_ _ diem would not listen to lodge _ _
_ _ cable 243 deptel 243 followed dated august 24 declaring that washington would no longer tolerate nhus actions and lodge was ordered to pressure diem to remove nhu _ _
_ _ lodge concluded that the only option was to get the south vietnamese generals to overthrow diem and nhu _ _
_ _ at weeks end orders were sent to saigon and throughout washington to destroy all coup cables _ _
_ _ at the same time the first formal antivietnam war sentiment was expressed by us clergy from the ministers vietnam committee _ _
_ _ a white house meeting in september was indicative of the different ongoing appraisals kennedy received updated assessments after personal inspections on the ground by the departments of defense general victor krulak and state joseph mendenhall _ _
_ _ krulak said that the military fight against the communists was progressing and being won while mendenhall stated that the country was civilly being lost to any us influence _ _
_ _ kennedy reacted asking did you two gentlemen visit the same country _ _
_ _ kennedy was unaware that both men were so much at odds that they did not speak to each other on the return flight _ _
_ _ in october 1963 kennedy appointed defense secretary mcnamara and general maxwell d taylor to a vietnamese mission in another effort to synchronize the information and formulation of policy _ _
_ _ the objective of the mcnamara taylor mission emphasized the importance of getting to the bottom of the differences in reporting from us representatives in vietnam _ _
_ _ in meetings with mcnamara taylor and lodge diem again refused to agree to governing measures helping to dispel mcnamaras previous optimism about diem _ _
_ _ taylor and mcnamara were enlightened by vietnams vice president nguyen ngoc tho choice of many to succeed diem who in detailed terms obliterated taylors information that the military was succeeding in the countryside _ _
_ _ at kennedys insistence the mission report contained a recommended schedule for troop withdrawals 1000 by years end and complete withdrawal in 1965 something the nsc considered to be a strategic fantasy _ _
_ _ in late october intelligence wires again reported that a coup against the diem government was afoot _ _
_ _ the source vietnamese general duong van minh also known as big minh wanted to know the us position _ _
_ _ kennedy instructed lodge to offer covert assistance to the coup excluding assassination _ _
_ _ on november 1 1963 south vietnamese generals led by big minh overthrew the diem government arresting and then killing diem and nhu _ _
_ _ kennedy was shocked by the deaths _ _
_ _ news of the coup led to renewed confidence initially—both in america and in south vietnam—that the war might be won _ _
_ _ mcgeorge bundy drafted a national security action memo to present to kennedy upon his return from dallas _ _
_ _ it reiterated the resolve to fight communism in vietnam with increasing military and economic aid and expansion of operations into laos and cambodia _ _
_ _ before leaving for dallas kennedy told michael forrestal that after the first of the year  he wanted an in depth study of every possible option including how to get out of there  to review this whole thing from the bottom to the top _ _
_ _ asked what he thought kennedy meant forrestal said it was devils advocate stuff _ _
_ _ historians disagree on whether the vietnam war would have escalated if kennedy had not been assassinated and had won reelection in 1964 _ _
_ _ fueling the debate were statements made by secretary of defense mcnamara in the film the fog of war that kennedy was strongly considering pulling the united states out of vietnam after the 1964 election _ _
_ _ the film also contains a tape recording of lyndon johnson stating that kennedy was planning to withdraw a position in which johnson disagreed _ _
_ _ kennedy had signed national security action memorandum nsam 263 dated october 11 which ordered the withdrawal of 1000 military personnel by years end and the bulk of them out by 1965 _ _
_ _ such an action would have been a policy reversal but kennedy was publicly moving in a less hawkish direction since his speech on world peace at american university on june 10 1963 _ _
_ _ at the time of kennedys death no final policy decision was made to vietnam _ _
_ _ in 2008 kennedy administration white house counsel and speechwriter ted sorensen wrote i would like to believe that kennedy would have found a way to withdraw all american instructors and advisors from vietnam _ _
_ _ but _ _
_ _ i do not believe he knew in his last weeks what he was going to do _ _
_ _ sorensen added that in his opinion vietnam was the only foreign policy problem handed off by jfk to his successor in no better and possibly worse shape than it was when he inherited it _ _
_ _ us involvement in the region escalated until his successor lyndon johnson directly deployed regular us military forces for fighting the vietnam war _ _
_ _ after kennedys assassination president johnson signed nsam 273 on november 26 1963 _ _
_ _ it reversed kennedys decision to withdraw 1000 troops and reaffirmed the policy of assistance to the south vietnamese _ _
_ _ on june 10 1963 kennedy at the high point of his rhetorical powers delivered the commencement address at american university in washington dc also known as a strategy of peace not only did kennedy outline a plan to curb nuclear arms but he also laid out a hopeful yet realistic route for world peace at a time when the us and soviet union faced the potential for an escalating nuclear arms race _ _
_ _ kennedy wished _ _
_ _ to discuss a topic on which too often ignorance abounds and the truth is too rarely perceived—yet it is the most important topic on earth world peace _ _
_ _ i speak of peace because of the new face of war  in an age when a singular nuclear weapon contains ten times the explosive force delivered by all the allied forces in the second world war  an age when the deadly poisons produced by a nuclear exchange would be carried by wind and air and soil and seed to the far corners of the globe and to generations yet unborn _ _
_ _ i speak of peace therefore as the necessary rational end of rational men  world peace like community peace does not require that each man love his neighbor—it requires only that they live together in mutual tolerance  our problems are manmade—therefore they can be solved by man _ _
_ _ and man can be as big as he wants _ _
_ _ kennedy also made two announcements 1 _ _
_ _ that the soviets had expressed a desire to negotiate a nuclear test ban treaty and 2 _ _
_ _ that the us had postponed planned atmospheric tests _ _
_ _ in 1963 germany was enduring a time of particular vulnerability due to soviet aggression to the east as well as the impending retirement of west german chancellor adenauer _ _
_ _ at the same time french president charles de gaulle was trying to build a francowest german counterweight to the american and soviet spheres of influence _ _
_ _ to kennedys eyes this francogerman cooperation seemed directed against natos influence in europe _ _
_ _ to reinforce the us alliance with west germany kennedy travelled to west germany and west berlin in june 1963 _ _
_ _ on june 26 kennedy toured west berlin culminating in a public speech at west berlins city hall in front of hundreds of thousands of enthusiastic berliners _ _
_ _ he reiterated the american commitment to germany and criticized communism and was met with an ecstatic response from a massive audience _ _
_ _ kennedy used the construction of the berlin wall as an example of the failures of communism freedom has many difficulties and democracy is not perfect _ _
_ _ but we have never had to put a wall up to keep our people in to prevent them from leaving us _ _
_ _ the speech is known for its famous phrase ich bin ein berliner i am a berliner which kennedy himself had begun to try out in preparation for the trip _ _
_ _ kennedy remarked to ted sorensen afterwards well never have another day like this one as long as we live _ _
_ _ in 1960 kennedy stated israel will endure and flourish _ _
_ _ it is the child of hope and the home of the brave _ _
_ _ it can neither be broken by adversity nor demoralized by success _ _
_ _ it carries the shield of democracy and it honors the sword of freedom _ _
_ _ as president kennedy initiated the creation of security ties with israel and he is credited as the founder of the usisraeli military alliance which would be continued under subsequent presidents _ _
_ _ kennedy ended the arms embargo that the eisenhower and truman administrations had enforced on israel _ _
_ _ describing the protection of israel as a moral and national commitment he was the first to introduce the concept of a special relationship as he described it to golda meir between the us and israel _ _
_ _ kennedy extended the first informal security guarantees to israel in 1962 and beginning in 1963 was the first us president to allow the sale to israel of advanced us weaponry the mim23 hawk as well as to provide diplomatic support for israeli policies which were opposed by arab neighbors those policies included israels water project on the jordan river _ _
_ _ as a result of this newly created security alliance kennedy also encountered tensions with the israeli government over the production of nuclear materials in dimona which he believed could instigate a nuclear armsrace in the middle east _ _
_ _ after the existence of a nuclear plant was initially denied by the israeli government david bengurion stated in a speech to the israeli knesset on december 21 1960 that the purpose of the nuclear plant at beersheba was for research in problems of arid zones and desert flora and fauna _ _
_ _ when bengurion met with kennedy in new york he claimed that dimona was being developed to provide nuclear power for desalinization and other peaceful purposes for the time being _ _
_ _ in 1963 the kennedy administration was engaged in a nowdeclassified diplomatic standoff with the leaders of israel _ _
_ _ in a may 1963 letter to bengurion kennedy wrote that he was skeptical and stated that american support to israel could be in jeopardy if reliable information on the israeli nuclear program was not forthcoming bengurion repeated previous reassurances that dimona was being developed for peaceful purposes _ _
_ _ the israeli government resisted american pressure to open its nuclear facilities to international atomic energy agency iaea inspections _ _
_ _ in 1962 the us and israeli governments had agreed to an annual inspection regime _ _
_ _ a science attaché at the embassy in tel aviv concluded that parts of the dimona facility had been shut down temporarily to mislead american scientists when they visited _ _
_ _ according to seymour hersh the israelis set up false control rooms to show the americans _ _
_ _ israeli lobbyist abe feinberg stated it was part of my job to tip them off that kennedy was insisting on an inspection _ _
_ _ hersh contends that the inspections were conducted in such a way that it guaranteed that the whole procedure would be little more than a whitewash as the president and his senior advisors had to understand the american inspection team would have to schedule its visits well in advance and with the full acquiescence of israel _ _
_ _ marc trachtenberg argued that lthough he was well aware of what the israelis were doing kennedy chose to take this as satisfactory evidence of israeli compliance with americas nonproliferation policy _ _
_ _ the documents reveal the deep concern the kennedy administration had over dimona and while kennedy understood the united states and the international community may not be capable of preventing israel or any nation he certainly was not satisfied to learn israel was using dimona for the production of plutonium _ _
_ _ the american who led the inspection team stated that the essential goal of the inspections was to find ways to not reach the point of taking action against israels nuclear weapons program _ _
_ _ rodger davies the director of the state departments office of near eastern affairs concluded in march 1965 that israel was developing nuclear weapons _ _
_ _ he reported that israels target date for achieving nuclear capability was 1968–1969 _ _
_ _ on may 1 1968 undersecretary of state nicholas katzenbach told president johnson that dimona was producing enough plutonium to produce two bombs a year _ _
_ _ the state department argued that if israel wanted arms it should accept international supervision of its nuclear program _ _
_ _ dimona was never placed under iaea safeguards _ _
_ _ attempts to write israeli adherence to the nuclear nonproliferation treaty npt into contracts for the supply of us weapons continued throughout 1968 _ _
_ _ israeli national interests to an extent were also at odds with kennedys endorsement of the united nations johnson plan which devised a plan to return a small percentage of displaced palestinians from the war of 1948 into what was by then israel _ _
_ _ this continuation of the late un secretary general dag hammarskjolds plan for palestinian repatriation particularity disturbed persons who had a hard line view of even arab resettlement in israel or the more heavily feared full repatriation _ _

_ _ the united kingdom—which had just granted kuwait independence on june 19 and whose economy was dependent on kuwaiti oil—responded on july 1 by dispatching 5000 troops to the country to deter an iraqi invasion _ _
_ _ at the same time kennedy dispatched a us navy task force to bahrain and the uk at the urging of the kennedy administration brought the dispute to united nations security council where the proposed resolution was vetoed by the soviet union _ _
_ _ the situation was resolved in october when the british troops were withdrawn and replaced by a 4000strong arab league force which acted as a barrier against the iraqi threat _ _
_ _ in december 1961 qasims government passed public law 80 which restricted the partially americancontrolled iraq petroleum company ipcs concessionary holding to those areas in which oil was actually being produced effectively expropriating 995 of the ipc concession _ _
_ _ us officials were alarmed by the expropriation as well as the recent soviet veto of an egyptiansponsored un resolution requesting the admittance of kuwait as un member state which they believed were connected _ _
_ _ senior national security council adviser robert komer worried that if the ipc ceased production in response qasim might grab kuwait thus achieving a stranglehold on middle eastern oil production or throw himself into russian arms _ _
_ _ komer also made note of widespread rumors that a nationalist coup against qasim could be imminent and had the potential to get iraq back on  more neutral keel _ _
_ _ in april 1962 the state department issued new guidelines on iraq that were intended to increase american influence there _ _
_ _ meanwhile kennedy instructed the cia—under the direction of archibald bulloch roosevelt jr—to begin making preparations for a military coup against qasim _ _
_ _ the antiimperialist and anticommunist iraqi baath party overthrew and executed qasim in a violent coup on february 8 1963 _ _

_ _ in response the united states conducted tests five days later _ _
_ _ shortly afterwards new us satellites began delivering images that made it clear that the soviets were substantially behind the us in the arms race _ _
_ _ nevertheless the greater nuclear strength of the us was of little value as long as the ussr perceived itself to be at parity _ _
_ _ in july 1963 kennedy sent w averell harriman to moscow to negotiate a treaty with the soviets _ _
_ _ the introductory sessions included khrushchev who later delegated soviet representation to andrei gromyko _ _
_ _ it quickly became clear that a comprehensive test ban would not be implemented due largely to the reluctance of the soviets to allow inspections that would verify compliance _ _

_ _ yale law professor charles reich opined in the new republic that the administration had violated civil liberties by calling a grand jury to indict us steel for collusion so quickly _ _
_ _ an editorial in the new york times praised kennedys actions and said that the steel industrys price increase imperil the economic welfare of the country by inviting a tidal wave of inflation _ _
_ _ nevertheless the administrations bureau of budget reported the price increase would have caused a net gain for the gdp as well as a net budget surplus _ _

_ _ in his first state of the union address in january 1961 president kennedy said the denial of constitutional rights to some of our fellow americans on account of race—at the ballot box and elsewhere—disturbs the national conscience and subjects us to the charge of world opinion that our democracy is not equal to the high promise of our heritage _ _

_ _ the day ended with the murder of an naacp leader medgar evers in front of his home in mississippi _ _

_ _ when arthur m schlesinger jr complimented kennedy on his remarks kennedy bitterly replied yes and look at what happened to area development the very next day in the house _ _
_ _ he then added but of course i had to give that speech and im glad that i did _ _
_ _ on june 16 the new york times published an editorial which argued that while kennedy had initially moved too slowly and with little evidence of deep moral commitment in regards to civil rights he now demonstrate a genuine sense of urgency about eradicating racial discrimination from our national life _ _

_ _ thousands of troops were placed on standby _ _
_ _ kennedy watched kings speech on tv and was very impressed _ _
_ _ the march was considered a triumph of managed protest and not one arrest relating to the demonstration occurred _ _
_ _ afterwards the march leaders accepted an invitation to the white house to meet with kennedy and photos were taken _ _
_ _ kennedy felt that the march was a victory for him as well and bolstered the chances for his civil rights bill _ _
_ _ nevertheless the struggle was far from over _ _
_ _ three weeks later on sunday september 15 a bomb exploded at the 16th street baptist church in birmingham by the end of the day four african american children had died in the explosion and two other children were shot to death in the aftermath _ _

_ _ although kennedy only gave written approval for limited wiretapping of kings phones on a trial basis for a month or so hoover extended the clearance so his men were unshackled to look for evidence in any areas of kings life they deemed worthy _ _
_ _ the wiretapping continued through june 1966 and was revealed in 1968 _ _
_ _ during the 1960 campaign kennedy proposed an overhaul of american immigration and naturalization laws to ban discrimination based on national origin _ _
_ _ he saw this proposal as an extension of his planned civil rights agenda as president _ _
_ _ these reforms later became law through the immigration and nationality act of 1965 which dramatically shifted the source of immigration from northern and western european countries towards immigration from latin america and asia _ _

_ _ webb proved to be adept at obtaining the support of congress the president and the american people _ _
_ _ kennedy also persuaded congress to amend the national aeronautics and space act to allow him to delegate his chairmanship of the national aeronautics and space council to the vice president

_ _ khrushchev declined as the soviets did not wish to reveal the status of their rocketry and space capabilities _ _
