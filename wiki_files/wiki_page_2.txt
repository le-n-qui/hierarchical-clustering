_ _ in the presidential campaign of 1796 jefferson lost the electoral college vote to federalist john adams by 71–68 and was thus elected vice president _ _

_ _ he cast only three tiebreaking votes in the senate _ _
_ _ in four confidential talks with french consul joseph létombe in the spring of 1797 jefferson attacked adams and predicted that his rival would serve only one term _ _
_ _ he also encouraged france to invade england and advised létombe to stall any american envoys sent to paris by instructing him to listen to them and then drag out the negotiations at length and mollify them by the urbanity of the proceedings _ _
_ _ this toughened the tone that the french government adopted toward the adams administration _ _
_ _ after adamss initial peace envoys were rebuffed jefferson and his supporters lobbied for the release of papers related to the incident called the xyz affair after the letters used to disguise the identities of the french officials involved _ _

_ _ to rally opposition he and james madison anonymously wrote the kentucky and virginia resolutions declaring that the federal government had no right to exercise powers not specifically delegated to it by the states _ _
_ _ the resolutions followed the interposition approach of madison in which states may shield their citizens from federal laws that they deem unconstitutional _ _
_ _ jefferson advocated nullification allowing states to invalidate federal laws altogether _ _
_ _ he warned that unless arrested at the threshold the alien and sedition acts would necessarily drive these states into revolution and blood _ _
_ _ historian ron chernow claims that the theoretical damage of the kentucky and virginia resolutions was deep and lasting and was a recipe for disunion contributing to the american civil war as well as later events _ _

_ _ jefferson contended for president once more against adams in 1800 _ _
_ _ adamss campaign was weakened by unpopular taxes and vicious federalist infighting over his actions in the quasiwar _ _
_ _ democraticrepublicans pointed to the alien and sedition acts and accused the federalists of being secret probritain monarchists while federalists charged that jefferson was a godless libertine beholden to the french _ _
_ _ historian joyce appleby said the election was one of the most acrimonious in the annals of american history _ _
_ _ the democraticrepublicans ultimately won more electoral college votes due in part to the electors that resulted from the addition of threefifths of the souths slaves to the population calculation _ _
_ _ jefferson and his vicepresidential candidate aaron burr unexpectedly received an equal total _ _
_ _ because of the tie the election was decided by the federalistdominated house of representatives _ _
_ _ hamilton lobbied federalist representatives on jeffersons behalf believing him a lesser political evil than burr _ _
_ _ on february 17 1801 after thirtysix ballots the house elected jefferson president and burr vice president _ _
_ _ jefferson became the second incumbent vice president to be elected president _ _
_ _ the win was marked by democraticrepublican celebrations throughout the country _ _
_ _ some of jeffersons opponents argued that he owed his victory over adams to the souths inflated number of electors due to the counting slaves under the threefifths compromise _ _
_ _ others alleged that jefferson secured james asheton bayards tiebreaking electoral vote by guaranteeing the retention of various federalist posts in the government _ _
_ _ jefferson disputed the allegation and the historical record is inconclusive _ _
_ _ the transition proceeded smoothly marking a watershed in american history _ _

_ _ jefferson was sworn in by chief justice john marshall at the new capitol in washington dc on march 4 1801 _ _
_ _ his inauguration was not attended by outgoing president adams _ _
_ _ in contrast to his predecessors jefferson exhibited a dislike of formal etiquette _ _

_ _ she accepted realizing the diplomatic importance of the position _ _
_ _ she was also in charge of the completion of the white house mansion _ _
_ _ dolley served as white house hostess for the rest of jeffersons two terms and then eight more years as first lady to president james madison _ _
_ _ jeffersons first official challenge was the 83 million national debt _ _
_ _ he began dismantling hamiltons federalist fiscal system with help from the secretary of the treasury albert gallatin _ _
_ _ gallatin devised a plan to eliminate the national debt in sixteen years by extensive annual appropriations and reduction in taxes _ _
_ _ the administration eliminated the whiskey excise and other taxes after closing unnecessary offices and cutting useless establishments and expenses _ _
_ _ jefferson believed that the first bank of the united states represented a most deadly hostility to republican government _ _
_ _ he wanted to dismantle the bank before its charter expired in 1811 but was dissuaded by gallatin _ _
_ _ gallatin argued that the national bank was a useful financial institution and set out to expand its operations _ _
_ _ jefferson looked to other corners to address the growing national debt _ _
_ _ he shrank the navy for example deeming it unnecessary in peacetime and incorporated a fleet of inexpensive gunboats intended only for local defense to avoid provocation against foreign powers _ _
_ _ after two terms he had lowered the national debt from 83 million to 57 million _ _
_ _ jefferson pardoned several of those imprisoned under the alien and sedition acts _ _
_ _ congressional republicans repealed the judiciary act of 1801 which removed nearly all of adamss midnight judges from office _ _
_ _ a subsequent appointment battle led to the supreme courts landmark decision in marbury v madison asserting judicial review over executive branch actions _ _
_ _ jefferson appointed three supreme court justices william johnson 1804 henry brockholst livingston 1807 and thomas todd 1807 _ _
_ _ jefferson strongly felt the need for a national military university producing an officer engineering corps for a national defense based on the advancement of the sciences rather than having to rely on foreign sources for top grade engineers with questionable loyalty _ _
_ _ he signed the military peace establishment act on march 16 1802 thus founding the united states military academy at west point _ _
_ _ the act documented in 29 sections a new set of laws and limits for the military _ _
_ _ jefferson was also hoping to bring reform to the executive branch replacing federalists and active opponents throughout the officer corps to promote republican values _ _
_ _ jefferson took great interest in the library of congress which had been established in 1800 _ _
_ _ he often recommended books to acquire _ _
_ _ in 1802 congress authorized president jefferson to name the first librarian of congress and formed a committee to establish library rules and regulations _ _
_ _ congress also granted the president and vice president the right to use the library _ _
_ _ american merchant ships had been protected from barbary coast pirates by the royal navy when the states were british colonies _ _
_ _ after independence however pirates often captured us merchant ships pillaged cargoes and enslaved or held crew members for ransom _ _
_ _ jefferson had opposed paying tribute to the barbary states since 1785 _ _
_ _ in 1801 he authorized a us navy fleet under commodore richard dale to make a show of force in the mediterranean the first american naval squadron to cross the atlantic _ _
_ _ following the fleets first engagement he successfully asked congress for a declaration of war _ _
_ _ the subsequent first barbary war was the first foreign war fought by the us _ _
_ _ pasha of tripoli yusuf karamanli captured the uss philadelphia so jefferson authorized william eaton the us consul to tunis to lead a force to restore the pashas older brother to the throne _ _
_ _ the american navy forced tunis and algiers into breaking their alliance with tripoli _ _
_ _ jefferson ordered five separate naval bombardments of tripoli leading the pasha to sign a treaty that restored peace in the mediterranean _ _
_ _ this victory proved only temporary but according to wood many americans celebrated it as a vindication of their policy of spreading free trade around the world and as a great victory for liberty over tyranny _ _
_ _ spain ceded ownership of the louisiana territory in 1800 to the more predominant france _ _
_ _ jefferson was greatly concerned that napoleons broad interests in the vast territory would threaten the security of the continent and mississippi river shipping _ _
_ _ he wrote that the cession works most sorely on the us _ _
_ _ it completely reverses all the political relations of the us in 1802 he instructed james monroe and robert r livingston to negotiate with napoleon to purchase new orleans and adjacent coastal areas from france _ _
_ _ in early 1803 jefferson offered napoleon nearly 10 million for 40000 square miles 100000 square kilometers of tropical territory _ _
_ _ napoleon realized that french military control was impractical over such a vast remote territory and he was in dire need of funds for his wars on the home front _ _
_ _ in early april 1803 he unexpectedly made negotiators a counteroffer to sell 827987 square miles 2144480 square kilometers of french territory for 15 million doubling the size of the united states _ _
_ _ us negotiators seized this unique opportunity and accepted the offer and signed the treaty on april 30 1803 _ _
_ _ word of the unexpected purchase did not reach jefferson until july 3 1803 _ _
_ _ he unknowingly acquired the most fertile tract of land of its size on earth making the new country selfsufficient in food and other resources _ _
_ _ the sale also significantly curtailed the european presence in north america removing obstacles to us westward expansion _ _
_ _ most thought that this was an exceptional opportunity despite republican reservations about the constitutional authority of the federal government to acquire land _ _
_ _ jefferson initially thought that a constitutional amendment was necessary to purchase and govern the new territory but he later changed his mind fearing that this would give cause to oppose the purchase and he therefore urged a speedy debate and ratification _ _
_ _ on october 20 1803 the senate ratified the purchase treaty by a vote of 24–7 _ _
_ _ jefferson personally was humble about acquiring the louisiana territory but he resented complainers who called the vast domain a howling wilderness _ _
_ _ after the purchase jefferson preserved the regions spanish legal code and instituted a gradual approach to integrating settlers into american democracy _ _
_ _ he believed that a period of the federal rule would be necessary while louisianians adjusted to their new nation _ _
_ _ historians have differed in their assessments regarding the constitutional implications of the sale but they typically hail the louisiana acquisition as a major accomplishment _ _
_ _ frederick jackson turner called the purchase the most formative event in american history _ _
_ _ jefferson anticipated further westward settlements due to the louisiana purchase and arranged for the exploration and mapping of the uncharted territory _ _
_ _ he sought to establish a us claim ahead of competing european interests and to find the rumored northwest passage _ _
_ _ jefferson and others were influenced by exploration accounts of le page du pratz in louisiana 1763 and captain james cook in the pacific 1784 and they persuaded congress in 1804 to fund an expedition to explore and map the newly acquired territory to the pacific ocean _ _
_ _ jefferson appointed meriwether lewis and william clark to be leaders of the corps of discovery 1803–1806 _ _
_ _ in the months leading up to the expedition jefferson tutored lewis in the sciences of mapping botany natural history mineralogy and astronomy and navigation giving him unlimited access to his library at monticello which included the largest collection of books in the world on the subject of the geography and natural history of the north american continent along with an impressive collection of maps _ _
_ _ the expedition lasted from may 1804 to september 1806 see timeline and obtained a wealth of scientific and geographic knowledge including knowledge of many indian tribes _ _
_ _ in addition to the corps of discovery jefferson organized three other western expeditions the william dunbar and george hunter expedition on the ouachita river 1804–1805 the thomas freeman and peter custis expedition 1806 on the red river and the zebulon pike expedition 1806–1807 into the rocky mountains and the southwest _ _
_ _ all three produced valuable information about the american frontier _ _
_ _ jeffersons experiences with the american indians began during his boyhood in virginia and extended through his political career and into his retirement _ _
_ _ he refuted the contemporary notion that indians were inferior people and maintained that they were equal in body and mind to people of european descent _ _
_ _ as governor of virginia during the revolutionary war jefferson recommended moving the cherokee and shawnee tribes who had allied with the british to west of the mississippi river _ _
_ _ but when he took office as president he quickly took measures to avert another major conflict as american and indian societies were in collision and the british were inciting indian tribes from canada _ _
_ _ in georgia he stipulated that the state would release its legal claims for lands to its west in exchange for military support in expelling the cherokee from georgia _ _
_ _ this facilitated his policy of western expansion to advance compactly as we multiply _ _
_ _ in keeping with his enlightenment thinking president jefferson adopted an assimilation policy toward american indians known as his civilization program which included securing peaceful us – indian treaty alliances and encouraging agriculture _ _
_ _ jefferson advocated that indian tribes should make federal purchases by credit holding their lands as collateral for repayment _ _
_ _ various tribes accepted jeffersons policies including the shawnees led by black hoof the creek and the cherokees _ _
_ _ however some shawnees broke off from black hoof led by tecumseh and opposed jeffersons assimilation policies _ _
_ _ historian bernard sheehan argues that jefferson believed that assimilation was best for american indians second best was removal to the west _ _
_ _ he felt that the worst outcome of the cultural and resources conflict between american citizens and american indians would be their attacking the whites _ _
_ _ jefferson told secretary of war general henry dearborn indian affairs were then under the war department if we are constrained to lift the hatchet against any tribe we will never lay it down until that tribe is exterminated or driven beyond the mississippi _ _
_ _ miller agrees that jefferson believed that indians should assimilate to american customs and agriculture _ _
_ _ historians such as peter s onuf and merrill d peterson argue that jeffersons actual indian policies did little to promote assimilation and were a pretext to seize lands _ _
_ _ jeffersons successful first term occasioned his renomination for president by the republican party with george clinton replacing burr as his running mate _ _
_ _ the federalist party ran charles cotesworth pinckney of south carolina john adamss vicepresidential candidate in the 1800 election _ _
_ _ the jeffersonclinton ticket won overwhelmingly in the electoral college vote by 162 to 14 promoting their achievement of a strong economy lower taxes and the louisiana purchase _ _
_ _ in march 1806 a split developed in the republican party led by fellow virginian and former republican ally john randolph who viciously accused president jefferson on the floor of the house of moving too far in the federalist direction _ _
_ _ in so doing randolph permanently set himself apart politically from jefferson _ _
_ _ jefferson and madison had backed resolutions to limit or ban british imports in retaliation for british seizures of american shipping _ _
_ _ also in 1808 jefferson was the first president to propose a broad federal plan to build roads and canals across several states asking for 20 million further alarming randolph and believers of limited government _ _
_ _ jeffersons popularity further suffered in his second term due to his response to wars in europe _ _
_ _ positive relations with great britain had diminished due partly to the antipathy between jefferson and british diplomat anthony merry _ _
_ _ after napoleons decisive victory at the battle of austerlitz in 1805 napoleon became more aggressive in his negotiations over trading rights which american efforts failed to counter _ _
_ _ jefferson then led the enactment of the embargo act of 1807 directed at both france and great britain _ _
_ _ this triggered economic chaos in the us and was strongly criticized at the time resulting in jefferson having to abandon the policy a year later _ _
_ _ during the revolutionary era the states abolished the international slave trade but south carolina reopened it _ _
_ _ in his annual message of december 1806 jefferson denounced the violations of human rights attending the international slave trade calling on the newly elected congress to criminalize it immediately _ _
_ _ in 1807 congress passed the act prohibiting importation of slaves which jefferson signed _ _
_ _ the act established severe punishment against the international slave trade although it did not address the issue domestically _ _
_ _ in haiti jeffersons neutrality had allowed arms to enable the slave independence movement during its revolution and blocked attempts to assist napoleon who was defeated there in 1803 _ _
_ _ but he refused official recognition of the country during his second term in deference to southern complaints about the racial violence against slaveholders it was eventually extended to haiti in 1862 _ _
_ _ domestically jeffersons grandson james madison randolph became the first child born in the white house in 1806 _ _
_ _ following the 1801 electoral deadlock jeffersons relationship with his vice president former new york senator aaron burr rapidly eroded _ _
_ _ jefferson suspected burr of seeking the presidency for himself while burr was angered by jeffersons refusal to appoint some of his supporters to federal office _ _
_ _ burr was dropped from the republican ticket in 1804 _ _
_ _ the same year burr was soundly defeated in his bid to be elected new york governor _ _
_ _ during the campaign alexander hamilton publicly made callous remarks regarding burrs moral character _ _
_ _ subsequently burr challenged hamilton to a duel mortally wounding him on july 11 1804 _ _
_ _ burr was indicted for hamiltons murder in new york and new jersey causing him to flee to georgia although he remained president of the senate during supreme court justice samuel chases impeachment trial _ _
_ _ both indictments quietly died and burr was not prosecuted _ _
_ _ also during the election certain new england separatists approached burr desiring a new england federation and intimating that he would be their leader _ _
_ _ however nothing came of the plot since burr had lost the election and his reputation was ruined after killing hamilton _ _
_ _ in august 1804 burr contacted british minister anthony merry offering to cede us western territory in return for money and british ships _ _
_ _ after leaving office in april 1805 burr traveled west and conspired with louisiana territory governor james wilkinson beginning a largescale recruitment for a military expedition _ _
_ _ other plotters included ohio senator john smith and an irishman named harmon blennerhassett _ _
_ _ burr discussed a number of plots—seizing control of mexico or spanish florida or forming a secessionist state in new orleans or the western us _ _
_ _ historians remain unclear as to his true goal _ _
_ _ in the fall of 1806 burr launched a military flotilla carrying about 60 men down the ohio river _ _
_ _ wilkinson renounced the plot apparently from selfinterested motives he reported burrs expedition to jefferson who immediately ordered burrs arrest _ _
_ _ on february 13 1807 burr was captured in louisianas bayou pierre wilderness and sent to virginia to be tried for treason _ _
_ _ burrs 1807 conspiracy trial became a national issue _ _
_ _ jefferson attempted to preemptively influence the verdict by telling congress that burrs guilt was beyond question but the case came before his longtime political foe john marshall who dismissed the treason charge _ _
_ _ burrs legal team at one stage subpoenaed jefferson but jefferson refused to testify making the first argument for executive privilege _ _
_ _ instead jefferson provided relevant legal documents _ _
_ _ after a threemonth trial the jury found burr not guilty while jefferson denounced his acquittal _ _
_ _ jefferson subsequently removed wilkinson as territorial governor but retained him in the us military _ _
_ _ historian james n banner criticized jefferson for continuing to trust wilkinson a faithless plotter _ _
_ _ commanding general james wilkinson was a holdover of the washington and adams administrations _ _
_ _ wilkinson was rumored to be a skillful and unscrupolous plotter _ _
_ _ in 1804 wilkinson received 12000 pesos from the spanish for information on american boundary plans _ _
_ _ wilkinson also received advances on his salary and payments on claims submitted to secretary of war henry dearborn _ _
_ _ this damaging information apparently was unknown to jefferson _ _
_ _ in 1805 jefferson trusted wilkinson and appointed him louisiana territory governor admiring wilkinsons work ethic _ _
_ _ in january 1806 jefferson received information from kentucky us attorney joseph davies that wilkinson was on the spanish payroll _ _
_ _ jefferson took no action against wilkinson there being at the time a lack of evidence against wilkinson _ _
_ _ an investigation by the house in december 1807 exonerated wilkinson _ _
_ _ in 1808 a military court looked into wilkinson but lacked evidence to charge wilkinson _ _
_ _ jefferson retained wilkinson in the army and he was passed on by jefferson to jeffersons successor james madison _ _
_ _ evidence found in spanish archives in the twentieth century proved wilkinson was in fact on the spanish payroll _ _
_ _ in the aftermath of the louisiana purchase jefferson attempted to annex west florida from spain a nation under the control of emperor napoleon and the french empire after 1804 _ _
_ _ in his annual message to congress on december 3 1805 jefferson railed against spain over florida border depredations _ _
_ _ a few days later jefferson secretly requested a two million dollar expenditure to purchase florida _ _
_ _ representative and floor leader john randolph however opposed annexation and was upset over jeffersons secrecy on the matter and believed the money would land in the coffers of napoleon _ _
_ _ the two million dollar bill passed only after jefferson successfully maneuvered to replace randolph with barnabas bidwell as floor leader _ _
_ _ this aroused suspicion of jefferson and charges of undue executive influence over congress _ _
_ _ jefferson signed the bill into law in february 1806 _ _
_ _ six weeks later the law was made public _ _
_ _ the two million dollars was to be given to france as payment in turn to put pressure on spain to permit the annexation of florida by the united states _ _
_ _ france however was in no mood to allow spain to give up florida and refused the offer _ _
_ _ florida remained under the control of spain _ _
_ _ the failed venture damaged jeffersons reputation among his supporters _ _
_ _ the british conducted seizures of american shipping to search for british deserters from 1806 to 1807 american citizens were thus impressed into the british naval service _ _
_ _ in 1806 jefferson issued a call for a boycott of british goods on april 18 congress passed the nonimportation acts but they were never enforced _ _
_ _ later that year jefferson asked james monroe and william pinkney to negotiate with great britain to end the harassment of american shipping though britain showed no signs of improving relations _ _
_ _ the monroe–pinkney treaty was finalized but lacked any provisions to end the british policies and jefferson refused to submit it to the senate for ratification _ _
_ _ the british ship hms leopard fired upon the uss chesapeake off the virginia coast in june 1807 and jefferson prepared for war _ _
_ _ he issued a proclamation banning armed british ships from us waters _ _
_ _ he presumed unilateral authority to call on the states to prepare 100000 militia and ordered the purchase of arms ammunition and supplies writing the laws of necessity of selfpreservation of saving our country when in danger are of higher obligation than strict observance of written laws _ _
_ _ the uss revenge was dispatched to demand an explanation from the british government it also was fired upon _ _
_ _ jefferson called for a special session of congress in october to enact an embargo or alternatively to consider war _ _
_ _ in december 1807 news arrived that napoleon had extended the berlin decree globally banning british imports _ _
_ _ in britain king george iii ordered redoubling efforts at impressment including american sailors _ _
_ _ but the war fever of the summer faded congress had no appetite to prepare the us for war _ _
_ _ jefferson asked for and received the embargo act an alternative that allowed the us more time to build up defensive works militias and naval forces _ _
_ _ later historians have seen the irony in jeffersons assertion of such federal power _ _
_ _ meacham said that the embargo act was a projection of power that surpassed the alien and sedition acts and r b bernstein said that jefferson was pursuing policies resembling those he had cited in 1776 as grounds for independence and revolution _ _
_ _ in november 1807 jefferson for several days met with his cabinet to discuss the deteriorating foreign situation _ _
_ _ secretary of state james madison supported the embargo with equal vigor to jefferson while treasury secretary gallatin opposed it due to its indefinite time frame and the risk that it posed to the policy of american neutrality _ _
_ _ the us economy suffered criticism grew and opponents began evading the embargo _ _
_ _ instead of retreating jefferson sent federal agents to secretly track down smugglers and violators _ _
_ _ three acts were passed in congress during 1807 and 1808 called the supplementary the additional and the enforcement acts _ _
_ _ the government could not prevent american vessels from trading with the european belligerents once they had left american ports although the embargo triggered a devastating decline in exports _ _
_ _ most historians consider jeffersons embargo to have been ineffective and harmful to american interests _ _
_ _ appleby describes the strategy as jeffersons least effective policy and joseph ellis calls it an unadulterated calamity _ _
_ _ others however portray it as an innovative nonviolent measure which aided france in its war with britain while preserving american neutrality _ _
_ _ jefferson believed that the failure of the embargo was due to selfish traders and merchants showing a lack of republican virtue _ _
_ _ he maintained that had the embargo been widely observed it would have avoided war in 1812 _ _
_ _ in december 1807 jefferson announced his intention not to seek a third term _ _
_ _ he turned his attention increasingly to monticello during the last year of his presidency giving madison and gallatin almost total control of affairs _ _
_ _ shortly before leaving office in march 1809 jefferson signed the repeal of the embargo _ _
_ _ in its place the nonintercourse act was passed but it proved no more effective _ _
_ _ the day before madison was inaugurated as his successor jefferson said that he felt like a prisoner released from his chains _ _
_ _ following his retirement from the presidency jefferson continued his pursuit of educational interests he sold his vast collection of books to the library of congress and founded and built the university of virginia _ _
_ _ jefferson continued to correspond with many of the countrys leaders including his two protégées who succeeded him as president and the monroe doctrine bears a strong resemblance to solicited advice that jefferson gave to monroe in 1823 _ _
_ _ as he settled into private life at monticello jefferson developed a daily routine of rising early _ _
_ _ he would spend several hours writing letters with which he was often deluged _ _
_ _ in the midday he would often inspect the plantation on horseback _ _
_ _ in the evenings his family enjoyed leisure time in the gardens late at night jefferson would retire to bed with a book _ _
_ _ however his routine was often interrupted by uninvited visitors and tourists eager to see the icon in his final days turning monticello into a virtual hotel _ _
_ _ jefferson envisioned a university free of church influences where students could specialize in many new areas not offered at other colleges _ _
_ _ he believed that education engendered a stable society which should provide publicly funded schools accessible to students from all social strata based solely on ability _ _
_ _ he initially proposed his university in a letter to joseph priestley in 1800 and in 1819 the 76yearold jefferson founded the university of virginia _ _
_ _ he organized the state legislative campaign for its charter and with the assistance of edmund bacon purchased the location _ _
_ _ he was the principal designer of the buildings planned the universitys curriculum and served as the first rector upon its opening in 1825 _ _
_ _ jefferson was a strong disciple of greek and roman architectural styles which he believed to be most representative of american democracy _ _
_ _ each academic unit called a pavilion was designed with a twostory temple front while the library rotunda was modeled on the roman pantheon _ _
_ _ jefferson referred to the universitys grounds as the academical village and he reflected his educational ideas in its layout _ _
_ _ the ten pavilions included classrooms and faculty residences they formed a quadrangle and were connected by colonnades behind which stood the students rows of rooms _ _
_ _ gardens and vegetable plots were placed behind the pavilions and were surrounded by serpentine walls affirming the importance of the agrarian lifestyle _ _
_ _ the university had a library rather than a church at its center emphasizing its secular nature—a controversial aspect at the time _ _
_ _ when jefferson died in 1826 james madison replaced him as rector _ _
_ _ jefferson bequeathed most of his library to the university _ _
_ _ only one other expresident has founded a university namely millard fillmore who founded the university at buffalo _ _

_ _ the two men did not communicate directly for more than a decade after jefferson succeeded adams as president _ _
_ _ a brief correspondence took place between abigail adams and jefferson after jeffersons daughter polly died in 1804 in an attempt at reconciliation unknown to adams _ _
_ _ however an exchange of letters resumed open hostilities between adams and jefferson _ _
_ _ as early as 1809 benjamin rush signer of the declaration of independence desired that jefferson and adams reconcile and began to prod the two through correspondence to reestablish contact _ _
_ _ in 1812 adams wrote a short new years greeting to jefferson prompted earlier by rush to which jefferson warmly responded _ _

_ _ he excluded his youth emphasizing the revolutionary era _ _
_ _ he related that his ancestors came from wales to america in the early 17th century and settled in the western frontier of the virginia colony which influenced his zeal for individual and state rights _ _
_ _ jefferson described his father as uneducated but with a strong mind and sound judgement _ _
_ _ his enrollment in the college of william and mary and election to the continental congress in philadelphia in 1775 were included _ _
_ _ he also expressed opposition to the idea of a privileged aristocracy made up of large landowning families partial to the king and instead promoted the aristocracy of virtue and talent which nature has wisely provided for the direction of the interests of society  scattered with equal hand through all its conditions was deemed essential to a wellordered republic _ _
_ _ jefferson gave his insight into people politics and events _ _
_ _ the work is primarily concerned with the declaration and reforming the government of virginia _ _
_ _ he used notes letters and documents to tell many of the stories within the autobiography _ _
_ _ he suggested that this history was so rich that his personal affairs were better overlooked but he incorporated a selfanalysis using the declaration and other patriotism _ _

_ _ he has been described as the most influential of the founding fathers who supported the greek cause viewing it as similar to the american revolution _ _
_ _ by 1823 jefferson was exchanging ideas with greek scholar adamantios korais _ _
_ _ jefferson advised korais on building the political system of greece by using classical liberalism and examples from the american governmental system ultimately prescribing a government akin to that of a us _ _
_ _ state _ _

_ _ hamilton successfully argued that the implied powers given to the federal government in the constitution supported the creation of a national bank among other federal actions _ _

_ _ he therefore supported colonization plans that would transport freed slaves to another country such as liberia or sierra leone though he recognized the impracticability of such proposals _ _
_ _ during his presidency jefferson was for the most part publicly silent on the issue of slavery and emancipation as the congressional debate over slavery and its extension caused a dangerous north–south rift among the states with talk of a northern confederacy in new england _ _
_ _ the violent attacks on white slave owners during the haitian revolution due to injustices under slavery supported jeffersons fears of a race war increasing his reservations about promoting emancipation at that time _ _

_ _ scholars remain divided on whether jefferson truly condemned slavery and how he changed _ _
_ _ francis d cogliano traces the development of competing emancipationist then revisionist and finally contextualist interpretations from the 1960s to the present _ _

_ _ subsequently the thomas jefferson foundation tjf formed a ninemember research team of historians to assess the matter _ _

_ _ in july 2017 the tjf announced that archeological excavations at monticello had revealed what they believe to have been sally hemingss quarters adjacent to jeffersons bedroom _ _
_ _ in 2018 the tjf said that it considered the issue a settled historical matter _ _
_ _ since the results of the dna tests were made public the consensus among most historians has been that jefferson had a sexual relationship with sally hemings and that he was the father of her son eston hemings _ _
_ _ still a minority of scholars maintain the evidence is insufficient to prove jeffersons paternity conclusively _ _
_ _ based on dna and other evidence they note the possibility that additional jefferson males including his brother randolph jefferson and any one of randolphs four sons or his cousin could have fathered eston hemings or sally hemingss other children _ _
_ _ in 2002 historian merrill peterson said in the absence of direct documentary evidence either proving or refuting the allegation nothing conclusive can be said about jeffersons relations with sally hemings _ _
