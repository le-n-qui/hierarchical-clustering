_ _ in 1858 douglas was up for reelection in the us senate and lincoln hoped to defeat him _ _

_ _ it will become all one thing or all the other _ _
_ _ the speech created a stark image of the danger of disunion _ _

_ _ douglas emphasized his freeport doctrine that local settlers were free to choose whether to allow slavery and accused lincoln of having joined the abolitionists _ _
_ _ lincolns argument assumed a moral tone as he claimed douglas represented a conspiracy to promote slavery _ _

_ _ attempts at compromise followed but lincoln and the republicans rejected the proposed crittenden compromise as contrary to the partys platform of freesoil in the territories _ _
_ _ lincoln said i will suffer death before i consent  to any concession or compromise which looks like buying the privilege to take possession of this government to which we have a constitutional right _ _
_ _ lincoln tacitly supported the corwin amendment to the constitution which passed congress and was awaiting ratification by the states when lincoln took office _ _
_ _ that doomed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed _ _
_ _ a few weeks before the war lincoln sent a letter to every governor informing them congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the constitution _ _
_ _ en route to his inauguration lincoln addressed crowds and legislatures across the north _ _
_ _ he gave a particularly emotional farewell address upon leaving springfield he would never again return to springfield alive _ _
_ _ the presidentelect evaded suspected assassins in baltimore _ _
_ _ on february 23 1861 he arrived in disguise in washington dc which was placed under substantial military guard _ _
_ _ lincoln directed his inaugural address to the south proclaiming once again that he had no inclination to abolish slavery in the southern states _ _
_ _ apprehension seems to exist among the people of the southern states that by the accession of a republican administration their property and their peace and personal security are to be endangered _ _
_ _ there has never been any reasonable cause for such apprehension _ _
_ _ indeed the most ample evidence to the contrary has all the while existed and been open to their inspection _ _
_ _ it is found in nearly all the published speeches of him who now addresses you _ _
_ _ i do but quote from one of those speeches when i declare that i have no purpose directly or indirectly to interfere with the institution of slavery in the states where it exists _ _
_ _ i believe i have no lawful right to do so and i have no inclination to do so _ _
_ _ lincoln cited his plans for banning the expansion of slavery as the key source of conflict between north and south stating one section of our country believes slavery is right and ought to be extended while the other believes it is wrong and ought not to be extended _ _
_ _ this is the only substantial dispute _ _
_ _ the president ended his address with an appeal to the people of the south we are not enemies but friends _ _
_ _ we must not be enemies _ _
_ _ the mystic chords of memory stretching from every battlefield and patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land will yet swell the chorus of the union when again touched as surely they will be by the better angels of our nature _ _
_ _ the failure of the peace conference of 1861 signaled that legislative compromise was impossible _ _
_ _ by march 1861 no leaders of the insurrection had proposed rejoining the union on any terms _ _
_ _ meanwhile lincoln and the republican leadership agreed that the dismantling of the union could not be tolerated _ _
_ _ in his second inaugural address lincoln looked back on the situation at the time and said both parties deprecated war but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive and the other would accept war rather than let it perish and the war came _ _
_ _ major robert anderson commander of the unions fort sumter in charleston south carolina sent a request for provisions to washington and lincolns order to meet that request was seen by the secessionists as an act of war _ _
_ _ on april 12 1861 confederate forces fired on union troops at fort sumter and began the fight _ _
_ _ historian allan nevins argued that the newly inaugurated lincoln made three miscalculations underestimating the gravity of the crisis exaggerating the strength of unionist sentiment in the south and overlooking southern unionist opposition to an invasion _ _
_ _ william tecumseh sherman talked to lincoln during inauguration week and was sadly disappointed at his failure to realize that the country was sleeping on a volcano and that the south was preparing for war _ _
_ _ donald concludes that his repeated efforts to avoid collision in the months between inauguration and the firing on ft sumter showed he adhered to his vow not to be the first to shed fraternal blood _ _
_ _ but he also vowed not to surrender the forts _ _
_ _ the only resolution of these contradictory positions was for the confederates to fire the first shot they did just that _ _
_ _ on april 15 lincoln called on the states to send a total of 75000 volunteer troops to recapture forts protect washington and preserve the union which in his view remained intact despite the seceding states _ _
_ _ this call forced states to choose sides _ _
_ _ virginia seceded and was rewarded with the designation of richmond as the confederate capital despite its exposure to union lines _ _

_ _ local leaders groups later burned critical rail bridges to the capital and the army responded by arresting local maryland officials _ _
_ _ lincoln suspended the writ of habeas corpus where needed for the security of troops trying to reach washington _ _
_ _ john merryman one maryland official hindering the us troop movements petitioned supreme court chief justice roger b taney to issue a writ of habeas corpus _ _
_ _ in june in ex parte merryman taney not ruling on behalf of the supreme court issued the writ believing that article i section 9 of the constitution authorized only congress and not the president to suspend it _ _
_ _ but lincoln persisted with the policy of suspension in select areas _ _
_ _ lincoln took executive control of the war and shaped the union military strategy _ _
_ _ he responded to the unprecedented political and military crisis as commanderinchief by exercising unprecedented authority _ _
_ _ he expanded his war powers imposed a blockade on confederate ports disbursed funds before appropriation by congress suspended habeas corpus and arrested and imprisoned thousands of suspected confederate sympathizers _ _
_ _ lincoln gained the support of congress and the northern public for these actions _ _
_ _ lincoln also had to reinforce union sympathies in the border slave states and keep the war from becoming an international conflict _ _
_ _ it was clear from the outset that bipartisan support was essential to success and that any compromise alienated factions on both sides of the aisle such as the appointment of republicans and democrats to command positions _ _
_ _ copperheads criticized lincoln for refusing to compromise on slavery _ _
_ _ the radical republicans criticized him for moving too slowly in abolishing slavery _ _
_ _ on august 6 1861 lincoln signed the confiscation act that authorized judicial proceedings to confiscate and free slaves who were used to support the confederates _ _
_ _ the law had little practical effect but it signaled political support for abolishing slavery _ _
_ _ in august 1861 general john c frémont the 1856 republican presidential nominee without consulting washington issued a martial edict freeing slaves of the rebels _ _
_ _ lincoln canceled the illegal proclamation as politically motivated and lacking military necessity _ _
_ _ as a result union enlistments from maryland kentucky and missouri increased by over 40000 _ _
_ _ internationally lincoln wanted to forestall foreign military aid to the confederacy _ _
_ _ he relied on his combative secretary of state william seward while working closely with senate foreign relations committee chairman charles sumner _ _
_ _ in the 1861 trent affair which threatened war with great britain the us navy illegally intercepted a british mail ship the trent on the high seas and seized two confederate envoys britain protested vehemently while the us cheered _ _
_ _ lincoln ended the crisis by releasing the two diplomats _ _
_ _ biographer james g randall dissected lincolns successful techniques _ _
_ _ his restraint his avoidance of any outward expression of truculence his early softening of state departments attitude toward britain his deference toward seward and sumner his withholding of his paper prepared for the occasion his readiness to arbitrate his golden silence in addressing congress his shrewdness in recognizing that war must be averted and his clear perception that a point could be clinched for americas true position at the same time that satisfaction was given to a friendly country _ _
_ _ lincoln painstakingly monitored the telegraph reports coming into the war department _ _
_ _ he tracked all phases of the effort consulting with governors and selecting generals based on their success their state and their party _ _
_ _ in january 1862 after complaints of inefficiency and profiteering in the war department lincoln replaced war secretary simon cameron with edwin stanton _ _
_ _ stanton centralized the war departments activities auditing and canceling contracts saving the federal government 17000000 _ _
_ _ stanton was a staunch unionist probusiness conservative democrat who gravitated toward the radical republican faction _ _
_ _ he worked more often and more closely with lincoln than any other senior official _ _
_ _ stanton and lincoln virtually conducted the war together say thomas and hyman _ _
_ _ lincolns war strategy embraced two priorities ensuring that washington was welldefended and conducting an aggressive war effort for a prompt decisive victory _ _
_ _ twice a week lincoln met with his cabinet in the afternoon _ _
_ _ occasionally mary prevailed on him to take a carriage ride concerned that he was working too hard _ _
_ _ for his edification lincoln relied upon a book by his chief of staff general henry halleck entitled elements of military art and science halleck was a disciple of the european strategist antoinehenri jomini _ _
_ _ lincoln began to appreciate the critical need to control strategic points such as the mississippi river _ _
_ _ lincoln saw the importance of vicksburg and understood the necessity of defeating the enemys army rather than merely capturing territory _ _
_ _ in directing the unions war strategy lincoln valued the advice of gen winfield scott even after his retirement as commanding general of the united states army _ _
_ _ on june 23–24 1862 president lincoln made an unannounced visit to west point where he spent five hours consulting with scott regarding the handling of the civil war and the staffing of the war department _ _
_ _ after the union rout at bull run and winfield scotts retirement lincoln appointed major general george b mcclellan generalinchief _ _
_ _ mcclellan then took months to plan his virginia peninsula campaign _ _
_ _ mcclellans slow progress frustrated lincoln as did his position that no troops were needed to defend washington _ _
_ _ mcclellan in turn blamed the failure of the campaign on lincolns reservation of troops for the capitol _ _
_ _ in 1862 lincoln removed mcclellan for the generals continued inaction _ _
_ _ he elevated henry halleck in july and appointed john pope as head of the new army of virginia _ _
_ _ pope satisfied lincolns desire to advance on richmond from the north thus protecting washington from counterattack _ _
_ _ but pope was then soundly defeated at the second battle of bull run in the summer of 1862 forcing the army of the potomac back to defend washington _ _
_ _ despite his dissatisfaction with mcclellans failure to reinforce pope lincoln restored him to command of all forces around washington _ _
_ _ two days after mcclellans return to command general robert e lees forces crossed the potomac river into maryland leading to the battle of antietam _ _
_ _ that battle a union victory was among the bloodiest in american history it facilitated lincolns emancipation proclamation in january _ _
_ _ mcclellan then resisted the presidents demand that he pursue lees withdrawing army while general don carlos buell likewise refused orders to move the army of the ohio against rebel forces in eastern tennessee _ _
_ _ lincoln replaced buell with william rosecrans and after the 1862 midterm elections he replaced mcclellan with ambrose burnside _ _
_ _ the appointments were both politically neutral and adroit on lincolns part _ _
_ _ burnside against presidential advice launched an offensive across the rappahannock river and was defeated by lee at fredericksburg in december _ _
_ _ desertions during 1863 came in the thousands and only increased after fredericksburg so lincoln replaced burnside with joseph hooker _ _
_ _ in the 1862 midterm elections the republicans suffered severe losses due to rising inflation high taxes rumors of corruption suspension of habeas corpus military draft law and fears that freed slaves would come north and undermine the labor market _ _
_ _ the emancipation proclamation gained votes for republicans in rural new england and the upper midwest but cost votes in the irish and german strongholds and in the lower midwest where many southerners had lived for generations _ _
_ _ in the spring of 1863 lincoln was sufficiently optimistic about upcoming military campaigns to think the end of the war could be near the plans included attacks by hooker on lee north of richmond rosecrans on chattanooga grant on vicksburg and a naval assault on charleston _ _
_ _ hooker was routed by lee at the battle of chancellorsville in may then resigned and was replaced by george meade _ _
_ _ meade followed lee north into pennsylvania and beat him in the gettysburg campaign but then failed to follow up despite lincolns demands _ _
_ _ at the same time grant captured vicksburg and gained control of the mississippi river splitting the far western rebel states _ _
_ _ the federal governments power to end slavery was limited by the constitution which before 1865 was understood to reserve the issue to the individual states _ _
_ _ lincoln believed that slavery would be rendered obsolete if its expansion into new territories were prevented because these territories would be admitted to the union as free states and free states would come to outnumber slave states _ _
_ _ he sought to persuade the states to agree to compensation for emancipating their slaves _ _
_ _ lincoln rejected major general john c frémonts august 1861 emancipation attempt as well as one by major general david hunter in may 1862 on the grounds that it was not within their power and might upset loyal border states enough for them to secede _ _
_ _ in june 1862 congress passed an act banning slavery on all federal territory which lincoln signed _ _
_ _ in july the confiscation act of 1862 was enacted providing court procedures to free the slaves of those convicted of aiding the rebellion lincoln approved the bill despite his belief that it was unconstitutional _ _
_ _ he felt such action could be taken only within the war powers of the commanderinchief which he planned to exercise _ _
_ _ lincoln at this time reviewed a draft of the emancipation proclamation with his cabinet _ _
_ _ privately lincoln concluded that the confederacys slave base had to be eliminated _ _
_ _ copperheads argued that emancipation was a stumbling block to peace and reunification republican editor horace greeley of the new york tribune agreed _ _
_ _ in a letter of august 22 1862 lincoln said that while he personally wished all men could be free regardless of that his first obligation as president was to preserve the union _ _
_ _ my paramount object in this struggle is to save the union and is not either to save or to destroy slavery _ _
_ _ if i could save the union without freeing any slave i would do it and if i could save it by freeing all the slaves i would do it and if i could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone i would also do that _ _
_ _ what i do about slavery and the colored race i do because i believe it helps to save the union and what i forbear i forbear because i do not believe it would help to save the union  ¶ i have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty and i intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free _ _
_ _ on september 22 1862 lincoln issued the preliminary emancipation proclamation which announced that in states still in rebellion on january 1 1863 the slaves would be freed _ _
_ _ he kept his word and on january 1 1863 issued the emancipation proclamation freeing the slaves in 10 states not then under union control with exemptions specified for areas under such control _ _
_ _ lincolns comment on signing the proclamation was i never in my life felt more certain that i was doing right than i do in signing this paper _ _
_ _ he spent the next 100 days preparing the army and the nation for emancipation while democrats rallied their voters by warning of the threat that freed slaves posed to northern whites _ _
_ _ with the abolition of slavery in the rebel states now a military objective union armies advancing south liberated all three million slaves in the confederacy _ _
_ _ the emancipation proclamation having stated that freedmen would be received into the armed service of the united states enlisting these freedmen became official policy _ _
_ _ by the spring of 1863 lincoln was ready to recruit black troops in more than token numbers _ _
_ _ in a letter to tennessee military governor andrew johnson encouraging him to lead the way in raising black troops lincoln wrote the bare sight of 50000 armed and drilled black soldiers on the banks of the mississippi would end the rebellion at once _ _
_ _ by the end of 1863 at lincolns direction general lorenzo thomas had recruited 20 regiments of blacks from the mississippi valley _ _
_ _ lincoln spoke at the dedication of the gettysburg battlefield cemetery on november 19 1863 _ _
_ _ in 272 words and three minutes lincoln asserted that the nation was born not in 1789 but in 1776 conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal _ _
_ _ he defined the war as dedicated to the principles of liberty and equality for all _ _
_ _ he declared that the deaths of so many brave soldiers would not be in vain that slavery would end and the future of democracy would be assured that government of the people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth _ _
_ _ defying his prediction that the world will little note nor long remember what we say here the address became the most quoted speech in american history _ _
_ _ general ulysses grants victories at the battle of shiloh and in the vicksburg campaign impressed lincoln _ _
_ _ responding to criticism of grant after shiloh lincoln had said i cant spare this man _ _
_ _ he fights _ _
_ _ with grant in command lincoln felt the union army could advance in multiple theaters while also including black troops _ _
_ _ meades failure to capture lees army after gettysburg and the continued passivity of the army of the potomac persuaded lincoln to promote grant to supreme commander _ _
_ _ grant then assumed command of meades army _ _
_ _ lincoln was concerned that grant might be considering a presidential candidacy in 1864 _ _
_ _ he arranged for an intermediary to inquire into grants political intentions and once assured that he had none lincoln promoted grant to the newly revived rank of lieutenant general a rank which had been unoccupied since george washington _ _
_ _ authorization for such a promotion with the advice and consent of the senate was provided by a new bill which lincoln signed the same day he submitted grants name to the senate _ _
_ _ his nomination was confirmed by the senate on march 2 1864 _ _
_ _ grant in 1864 waged the bloody overland campaign which exacted heavy losses on both sides _ _
_ _ when lincoln asked what grants plans were the persistent general replied i propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer _ _
_ _ grants army moved steadily south _ _
_ _ lincoln traveled to grants headquarters at city point virginia to confer with grant and william tecumseh sherman _ _
_ _ lincoln reacted to union losses by mobilizing support throughout the north _ _
_ _ lincoln authorized grant to target infrastructure—plantations railroads and bridges—hoping to weaken the souths morale and fighting ability _ _
_ _ he emphasized defeat of the confederate armies over destruction which was considerable for its own sake _ _
_ _ lincolns engagement became distinctly personal on one occasion in 1864 when confederate general jubal early raided washington dc legend has it that while lincoln watched from an exposed position union captain and future supreme court justice oliver wendell holmes jr shouted at him get down you damn fool before you get shot _ _
_ _ as grant continued to weaken lees forces efforts to discuss peace began _ _
_ _ confederate vice president stephens led a group meeting with lincoln seward and others at hampton roads _ _
_ _ lincoln refused to negotiate with the confederacy as a coequal his objective to end the fighting was not realized _ _
_ _ on april 1 1865 grant nearly encircled petersburg in a siege _ _
_ _ the confederate government evacuated richmond and lincoln visited the conquered capital _ _
_ _ on april 9 lee surrendered to grant at appomattox officially ending the war _ _
_ _ lincoln ran for reelection in 1864 while uniting the main republican factions along with war democrats edwin m stanton and andrew johnson _ _
_ _ lincoln used conversation and his patronage powers—greatly expanded from peacetime—to build support and fend off the radicals efforts to replace him _ _
_ _ at its convention the republicans selected johnson as his running mate _ _
_ _ to broaden his coalition to include war democrats as well as republicans lincoln ran under the label of the new union party _ _
_ _ grants bloody stalemates damaged lincolns reelection prospects and many republicans feared defeat _ _
_ _ lincoln confidentially pledged in writing that if he should lose the election he would still defeat the confederacy before turning over the white house lincoln did not show the pledge to his cabinet but asked them to sign the sealed envelope _ _
_ _ the pledge read as follows _ _
_ _ this morning as for some days past it seems exceedingly probable that this administration will not be reelected _ _
_ _ then it will be my duty to so cooperate with the president elect as to save the union between the election and the inauguration as he will have secured his election on such ground that he cannot possibly save it afterward _ _
_ _ the democratic platform followed the peace wing of the party and called the war a failure but their candidate mcclellan supported the war and repudiated the platform _ _
_ _ meanwhile lincoln emboldened grant with more troops and republican party support _ _
_ _ shermans capture of atlanta in september and david farraguts capture of mobile ended defeatism _ _
_ _ the democratic party was deeply split with some leaders and most soldiers openly for lincoln _ _
_ _ the national union party was united by lincolns support for emancipation _ _
_ _ state republican parties stressed the perfidy of the copperheads _ _
_ _ on november 8 lincoln carried all but three states including 78 percent of union soldiers _ _
_ _ on march 4 1865 lincoln delivered his second inaugural address _ _
_ _ in it he deemed the war casualties to be gods will _ _
_ _ historian mark noll places the speech among the small handful of semisacred texts by which americans conceive their place in the world it is inscribed in the lincoln memorial _ _
_ _ lincoln said _ _
_ _ fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away _ _
_ _ yet if god wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondmans 250 years of unrequited toil shall be sunk and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword as was said 3000 years ago so still it must be said the judgments of the lord are true and righteous altogether _ _
_ _ with malice toward none with charity for all with firmness in the right as god gives us to see the right let us strive on to finish the work we are in to bind up the nations wounds to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations _ _
_ _ reconstruction preceded the wars end as lincoln and his associates considered the reintegration of the nation and the fates of confederate leaders and freed slaves _ _
_ _ when a general asked lincoln how the defeated confederates were to be treated lincoln replied let em up easy _ _
_ _ lincoln was determined to find meaning in the war in its aftermath and did not want to continue to outcast the southern states _ _
_ _ his main goal was to keep the union together so he proceeded by focusing not on whom to blame but on how to rebuild the nation as one _ _
_ _ lincoln led the moderates in reconstruction policy and was opposed by the radicals under rep thaddeus stevens sen charles sumner and sen benjamin wade who otherwise remained lincolns allies _ _
_ _ determined to reunite the nation and not alienate the south lincoln urged that speedy elections under generous terms be held _ _
_ _ his amnesty proclamation of december 8 1863 offered pardons to those who had not held a confederate civil office and had not mistreated union prisoners if they were willing to sign an oath of allegiance _ _
_ _ as southern states fell they needed leaders while their administrations were restored _ _
_ _ in tennessee and arkansas lincoln respectively appointed johnson and frederick steele as military governors _ _
_ _ in louisiana lincoln ordered general nathaniel p banks to promote a plan that would reestablish statehood when 10 percent of the voters agreed and only if the reconstructed states abolished slavery _ _
_ _ democratic opponents accused lincoln of using the military to ensure his and the republicans political aspirations _ _
_ _ the radicals denounced his policy as too lenient and passed their own plan the 1864 wade–davis bill which lincoln vetoed _ _
_ _ the radicals retaliated by refusing to seat elected representatives from louisiana arkansas and tennessee _ _
_ _ lincolns appointments were designed to harness both moderates and radicals _ _
_ _ to fill chief justice taneys seat on the supreme court he named the radicals choice salmon p chase who lincoln believed would uphold his emancipation and paper money policies _ _
_ _ after implementing the emancipation proclamation lincoln increased pressure on congress to outlaw slavery throughout the nation with a constitutional amendment _ _
_ _ he declared that such an amendment would clinch the whole matter and by december 1863 an amendment was brought to congress _ _
_ _ this first attempt fell short of the required twothirds majority in the house of representatives _ _
_ _ passage became part of lincolns reelection platform and after his successful reelection the second attempt in the house passed on january 31 1865 _ _
_ _ with ratification it became the thirteenth amendment to the united states constitution on december 6 1865 _ _
_ _ lincoln believed the federal government had limited responsibility to the millions of freedmen _ _
_ _ he signed senator charles sumners freedmens bureau bill that set up a temporary federal agency designed to meet the immediate needs of former slaves _ _
_ _ the law opened land for a lease of three years with the ability to purchase title for the freedmen _ _
_ _ lincoln announced a reconstruction plan that involved shortterm military control pending readmission under the control of southern unionists _ _
_ _ historians agree that it is impossible to predict exactly how reconstruction would have proceeded had lincoln lived _ _
_ _ biographers james g randall and richard current according to david lincove argue that _ _
_ _ it is likely that had he lived lincoln would have followed a policy similar to johnsons that he would have clashed with congressional radicals that he would have produced a better result for the freedmen than occurred and that his political skills would have helped him avoid johnsons mistakes _ _
_ _ eric foner argues that _ _
_ _ unlike sumner and other radicals lincoln did not see reconstruction as an opportunity for a sweeping political and social revolution beyond emancipation _ _
_ _ he had long made clear his opposition to the confiscation and redistribution of land _ _
_ _ he believed as most republicans did in april 1865 that the voting requirements should be determined by the states _ _
_ _ he assumed that political control in the south would pass to white unionists reluctant secessionists and forwardlooking former confederates _ _
_ _ but time and again during the war lincoln after initial opposition had come to embrace positions first advanced by abolitionists and radical republicans _ _
_ _ lincoln undoubtedly would have listened carefully to the outcry for further protection for the former slaves _ _
_ _ it is entirely plausible to imagine lincoln and congress agreeing on a reconstruction policy that encompassed federal protection for basic civil rights plus limited black suffrage along the lines lincoln proposed just before his death _ _
_ _ lincolns experience with native americans started early with their killing of his grandfather in front of the family _ _
_ _ later he served as a captain in the state militia during the black hawk war seeing no combat _ _
_ _ during his presidency his policy toward indians was based on politics _ _
_ _ he used appointments to the indian bureau as a reward to supporters from minnesota and wisconsin _ _
_ _ while in office his administration faced difficulties guarding western settlers railroads and telegraphs from indian attacks _ _
_ _ on august 17 1862 the sioux or dakota uprising broke out in minnesota _ _
_ _ hundreds of settlers were killed 30000 were displaced from their homes and washington was deeply alarmed _ _
_ _ some feared incorrectly that it might represent a confederate conspiracy to start a war on the northwestern frontier _ _
_ _ lincoln ordered thousands of confederate prisoners of war sent by railroad to put down the uprising _ _
_ _ when the confederates protested forcing confederate prisoners to fight indians lincoln revoked the policy and none set foot in minnesota _ _
_ _ lincoln sent general john pope to minnesota as commander of the new department of the northwest a couple of weeks into the hostilities _ _
_ _ before he arrived the fond du lac band of chippewa sent lincoln a letter begging to go to war for the united states against the sioux so lincoln could send minnesotas troops to fight the south _ _
_ _ shortly after a mille lacs band chief offered the same at st _ _
_ _ cloud minnesota _ _
_ _ in it the chippewa specified that they wanted to use the indigenous rules of warfare _ _
_ _ that meant there would be no prisoners of war no surrender no peace agreement _ _
_ _ lincoln did not accept the chippewa offer as he had no means to control the outcome and women and children were considered legitimate casualties in native american warfare _ _
_ _ once word reached the other bands of chippewa he had no way of knowing how they would react to his sending the fond du lac on the warpath _ _
_ _ one of the chippewa signing the letter chief nawgawnub had received a presidential medal from lincoln earlier in the year _ _
_ _ serving under gen pope was minnesota congressman henry h sibley _ _
_ _ minnesotas governor had made sibley a colonel united states volunteers to command the us force tasked with fighting the war and that eventually defeated little crows forces at the battle of wood lake _ _
_ _ the day the mdewakanton force surrendered at camp release a chippewa war council met at minnesotas capitol with another chippewa offer to lincoln to fight the sioux _ _
_ _ sibley ordered a military commission to review that actions of the captured to try those that had committed war crimes _ _
_ _ the legitimacy of military commissions trying opposing combatants had been established during the mexican war _ _
_ _ sibley thought he had 1620 of men he wanted for trial while gen pope ordered that all detained warriors be tried _ _
_ _ when it was done 303 had been given death sentences that were subject to presidential review _ _
_ _ lincoln ordered gen pope send all of the trial transcripts washington where he and two of his staff poured over the trials _ _
_ _ the lawyer in lincoln saw issues _ _
_ _ he slowly realized that the trials could be divided into two groups combat between combatants and combat against civilians _ _
_ _ the groups could be identified by their transcripts the first group were all just three pages in length while the second group had more pages some up to twelve _ _
_ _ he placed 263 cases into the first group and commuted their sentences for the  largest mass commutation in history _ _
_ _ into the second group went forty _ _
_ _ one he commuted for turning states witness _ _
_ _ another sibley dismissed when overwhelming proof surfaced exonerating the man _ _
_ _ the remaining 38 were executed in the largest mass hanging in us history _ _
_ _ very quickly questions arose concerning three of the executions that have not been answered _ _
_ _ less than four months after the executions lincoln issued general order 100 that relates more to the minnesota war than the civil war _ _
_ _ now a congressman alexander ramsey told lincoln in 1864 that he would have gotten more reelection support in minnesota had he executed all 303 of the mdewakanton _ _
_ _ lincoln responded i could not afford to hang men for votes _ _
_ _ the men whose sentences he commuted were sent to a military prison at davenport iowa _ _
_ _ a few of those he had released due to the efforts of bishop henry whipple _ _
_ _ lincoln adhered to the whig theory of a presidency focused on executing laws while deferring to congress responsibility for legislating _ _
_ _ lincoln vetoed only four bills including the wadedavis bill with its harsh reconstruction program _ _
_ _ the 1862 homestead act made millions of acres of western governmentheld land available for purchase at low cost _ _
_ _ the 1862 morrill landgrant colleges act provided government grants for agricultural colleges in each state _ _
_ _ the pacific railway acts of 1862 and 1864 granted federal support for the construction of the united states first transcontinental railroad which was completed in 1869 _ _
_ _ the passage of the homestead act and the pacific railway acts was enabled by the absence of southern congressmen and senators who had opposed the measures in the 1850s _ _
_ _ in the selection and use of his cabinet lincoln employed the strengths of his opponents in a manner that emboldened his presidency _ _
_ _ lincoln commented on his thought process we need the strongest men of the party in the cabinet _ _
_ _ we needed to hold our own people together _ _
_ _ i had looked the party over and concluded that these were the very strongest men _ _
_ _ then i had no right to deprive the country of their services _ _
_ _ goodwin described the group in her biography as a team of rivals _ _
_ _ there were two measures passed to raise revenues for the federal government tariffs a policy with long precedent and a federal income tax _ _
_ _ in 1861 lincoln signed the second and third morrill tariffs following the first enacted by buchanan _ _
_ _ he also signed the revenue act of 1861 creating the first us income tax—a flat tax of 3 percent on incomes above 800 24100 in current dollar terms _ _

_ _ he was deeply familiar with the bible quoting and praising it _ _
_ _ he was private about his position on organized religion and respected the beliefs of others _ _
_ _ he never made a clear profession of christian beliefs _ _
_ _ throughout his public career lincoln often quoted scripture _ _
_ _ his three most famous speeches—the house divided speech the gettysburg address and his second inaugural—each contain direct allusions to providence and quotes from scripture _ _
_ _ in the 1840s lincoln subscribed to the doctrine of necessity a belief that the human mind was controlled by a higher power _ _
_ _ with the death of his son edward in 1850 he more frequently expressed a dependence on god _ _
_ _ he never joined a church although he frequently attended first presbyterian church with his wife beginning in 1852 _ _
_ _ in the 1850s lincoln asserted his belief in providence in a general way and rarely used the language or imagery of the evangelicals he regarded the republicanism of the founding fathers with an almost religious reverence _ _
_ _ the death of son willie in february 1862 may have caused him to look toward religion for solace _ _
_ _ after willies death he questioned the divine necessity of the wars severity _ _
_ _ he wrote at this time that god could have either saved or destroyed the union without a human contest _ _
_ _ yet the contest began _ _
_ _ and having begun he could give the final victory to either side any day _ _
_ _ yet the contest proceeds _ _
_ _ lincoln did believe in an allpowerful god that shaped events and by 1865 was expressing those beliefs in major speeches _ _
_ _ by the end of the war he increasingly appealed to the almighty for solace and to explain events writing on april 4 1864 to a newspaper editor in kentucky _ _
_ _ i claim not to have controlled events but confess plainly that events have controlled me _ _
_ _ now at the end of three years struggle the nations condition is not what either party or any man devised or expected _ _
_ _ god alone can claim it _ _
_ _ whither it is tending seems plain _ _
_ _ if god now wills the removal of a great wrong and wills also that we of the north as well as you of the south shall pay fairly for our complicity in that wrong impartial history will find therein new cause to attest and revere the justice and goodness of god _ _
_ _ this spirituality can best be seen in his second inaugural address considered by some scholars as the greatest such address in american history and by lincoln himself as his own greatest speech or one of them at the very least _ _
_ _ lincoln explains therein that the cause purpose and result of the war was gods will _ _
_ _ lincolns frequent use of religious imagery and language toward the end of his life may have reflected his own personal beliefs or might have been a device to reach his audiences who were mostly evangelical protestants _ _

_ _ belz _ _
_ _ lincoln called the declaration of independence—which emphasized freedom and equality for all—the sheet anchor of republicanism beginning in the 1850s _ _
_ _ he did this at a time when the constitution which tolerated slavery was the focus of most political discourse _ _
_ _ diggins notes lincoln presented americans a theory of history that offers a profound contribution to the theory and destiny of republicanism itself in the 1860 cooper union speech _ _
_ _ instead of focusing on the legality of an argument he focused on the moral basis of republicanism _ _
_ _ his position on war was founded on a legal argument regarding the constitution as essentially a contract among the states and all parties must agree to pull out of the contract _ _
_ _ furthermore it was a national duty to ensure the republic stands in every state _ _
_ _ many soldiers and religious leaders from the north though felt the fight for liberty and freedom of slaves was ordained by their moral and religious beliefs _ _
_ _ as a whig activist lincoln was a spokesman for business interests favoring high tariffs banks infrastructure improvements and railroads in opposition to jacksonian democrats _ _
_ _ lincoln shared the sympathies that the jacksonians professed for the common man but he disagreed with the jacksonian view that the government should be divorced from economic enterprise _ _
_ _ nevertheless lincoln admired andrew jacksons steeliness as well as his patriotism _ _
_ _ according to historian sean wilentz _ _
_ _ just as the republican party of the 1850s absorbed certain elements of jacksonianism so lincoln whose whiggery had always been more egalitarian than that of other whigs found himself absorbing some of them as well _ _
_ _ and some of the jacksonian spirit resided inside the lincoln white house _ _
_ _ william c harris found that lincolns reverence for the founding fathers the constitution the laws under it and the preservation of the republic and its institutions strengthened his conservatism _ _
_ _ james g randall emphasizes his tolerance and moderation in his preference for orderly progress his distrust of dangerous agitation and his reluctance toward ill digested schemes of reform _ _
_ _ randall concludes that he was conservative in his complete avoidance of that type of socalled radicalism which involved abuse of the south hatred for the slaveholder thirst for vengeance partisan plotting and ungenerous demands that southern institutions be transformed overnight by outsiders _ _
_ _ in lincolns first inaugural address he explored the nature of democracy _ _
_ _ he denounced secession as anarchy and explained that majority rule had to be balanced by constitutional restraints _ _
_ _ he said a majority held in restraint by constitutional checks and limitations and always changing easily with deliberate changes of popular opinions and sentiments is the only true sovereign of a free people _ _
_ _ the successful reunification of the states had consequences for how people viewed the country _ _
_ _ the term the united states has historically been used sometimes in the plural these united states and other times in the singular _ _
_ _ the civil war was a significant force in the eventual dominance of the singular usage by the end of the 19th century _ _
_ _ in his company i was never reminded of my humble origin or of my unpopular color _ _
_ _ in surveys of us scholars ranking presidents conducted since 1948 the top three presidents are lincoln washington and franklin delano roosevelt although the order varies _ _

_ _ he was viewed by abolitionists as a champion of human liberty _ _
_ _ republicans linked lincolns name to their party _ _
_ _ many though not all in the south considered lincoln as a man of outstanding ability _ _
_ _ historians have said he was a classical liberal in the 19thcentury sense _ _
_ _ allen c guelzo states that lincoln was a classical liberal democrat—an enemy of artificial hierarchy a friend to trade and business as ennobling and enabling and an american counterpart to mill cobden and bright whose portrait lincoln hung in his white house office _ _
_ _ sociologist barry schwartz argues that lincolns american reputation grew slowly from the late 19th century until the progressive era 1900–1920s when he emerged as one of americas most venerated heroes even among white southerners _ _
_ _ the high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the lincoln memorial on the national mall in washington dc _ _
_ _ union nationalism as envisioned by lincoln helped lead america to the nationalism of theodore roosevelt woodrow wilson and franklin delano roosevelt _ _
_ _ in the new deal era liberals honored lincoln not so much as the selfmade man or the great war president but as the advocate of the common man who they claimed would have supported the welfare state _ _
_ _ schwartz argues that in the 1930s and 1940s the memory of abraham lincoln was practically sacred and provided the nation with a moral symbol inspiring and guiding american life _ _
_ _ during the great depression he argues lincoln served as a means for seeing the worlds disappointments for making its sufferings not so much explicable as meaningful _ _
_ _ franklin d roosevelt preparing america for war used the words of the civil war president to clarify the threat posed by germany and japan _ _
_ _ americans asked what would lincoln do _ _
_ _ however schwartz also finds that since world war ii lincolns symbolic power has lost relevance and this fading hero is symptomatic of fading confidence in national greatness _ _
_ _ he suggested that postmodernism and multiculturalism have diluted greatness as a concept _ _
_ _ in the cold war years lincolns image shifted to a symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes _ _
_ _ by the late 1960s some african american intellectuals led by lerone bennett jr rejected lincolns role as the great emancipator _ _
_ _ bennett won wide attention when he called lincoln a white supremacist in 1968 _ _
_ _ he noted that lincoln used ethnic slurs and told jokes that ridiculed blacks _ _
_ _ bennett argued that lincoln opposed social equality and proposed that freed slaves voluntarily move to another country _ _
_ _ the emphasis shifted away from lincoln the emancipator to an argument that blacks had freed themselves from slavery or at least were responsible for pressuring the government to emancipate them _ _
_ _ defenders of lincoln such as authors dirck and cashin retorted that he was not as bad as most politicians of his day and that he was a moral visionary who deftly advanced the abolitionist cause as fast as politically possible _ _
_ _ dirck stated that few civil war scholars take bennett seriously pointing to his narrow political agenda and faulty research _ _
_ _ by the 1970s lincoln had become a hero to political conservatives—apart from neoconfederates such as mel bradford who denounced his treatment of the white south—for his intense nationalism his support for business his insistence on stopping the spread of slavery his acting on lockean and burkean principles on behalf of both liberty and tradition and his devotion to the principles of the founding fathers _ _
_ _ lincoln became a favorite of liberal intellectuals across the world _ _
_ _ barry schwartz wrote in 2009 that lincolns image suffered erosion fading prestige benign ridicule in the late 20th century _ _
_ _ on the other hand donald opined in his 1996 biography that lincoln was distinctly endowed with the personality trait of negative capability defined by the poet john keats and attributed to extraordinary leaders who were content in the midst of uncertainties and doubts and not compelled toward fact or reason _ _
